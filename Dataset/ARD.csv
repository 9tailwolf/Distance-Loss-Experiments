I did not find any leather in this Bible Cover.  I do like the purse style and believe it is easier on the spine of large study Bibles.  However I wanted a leather cover and returned these because they were not a discribed.  Amazon was very gracious to give me a full refund and pay for all shipping.,1
"If you're looking for something high quality don't get this. It's a piece of paper. It wasn't well wrapped in the packing and was just shoved in the box. The box was wet upon arrival and the paper was mostly ruined. I'm unable to use it in my classroom. Wish I had gone with something better quality. It looks better in the picture than it does in person, especially when wet and wrinkled and doesn't come with the necessary items to attach the arrow (that I have to cut out on my own). For what I paid for it I definitely expected more. My kids like it and like the look of it. It's just not sturdy enough for a classroom. I'm going to have to attach cardboard to the back and hope I can iron it flat now that it's dry. Not sure how long it will last. Also have to go shopping to get something to somehow attach the arrow so that it will turn when the kids change the weather each day. Ugggh. NOT my best buy. Don't recommend it. It looks great, just not high enough quality for a classroom, especially one with younger kids (K - 2nd grade).",1

"I've alway held Rand McNally as the Gold Standard of maps, having worked in a map and globe specific retail establishment. However, the complete omission apart from random edges of  the 6th continent of Antartica, granted, I paid $5 for it, it came in decent time even with the dreaded postal handshake, but really? The coastline only of an entire continent as if it had no other features? Sorry, but I call foul, I wouldn't put this up in a kindergarten class, it will serve the purpose I'm using it for, but I don't recommend it for educational value.",1
"I don't know why Amazon can't put the actual and true size of this map on the site. Is it really THAT HARD? I couldn't figure out what the size of this thing was and the 31.5"" size indication with other ridiculous numbers is the height - so beware this thing is BIG. approx. 60"" wide and 32"" tall. Besides the size problem the map looks faintly printed and feels really cheap in general. It's not what I would call ""laminated"" more like ""coated with a nano layer of plastic"". Also, the slightest accidental bending while handling this huge map will likely leave a permanent crease or wrinkle in the map. Returned!",1
"I understand that these reviews should be based on the PRODUCT, but people just need to not purchase this particular map from Amazon.  As other people have complained about, I received the darn thing in a plastic bag. It was crumpled and creased beyond repair so I sent it back.  When I find someone else selling this map I will purchase it from them, hopefully they understand the benefits of cardboard tubes.  The map itself was exactly what I wanted.",1
"I love this map.  it is large, colorful and as near as I can tell, accurate.

HOWEVER, Amazon shipped this map to me, NOT IN A TUBE but rather between two flat pieces of cardboard.  My map came smashed, completely flat.  So now, upon unrolling in it has lines as if it was folded every two inches the entire length of the map which makes it look awful on my wall.  I'm not going to return it because since they didn't put it in a tube, I don't want to have to buy one.  But let buyer beware.",1
Arrived damaged,1
"DON""T BUY! Most classes you can use the clicker two, just go buy the clicker two. This one was unreliable, I couldn't tell if it sent my answer, and it won't work with all systems. I used it for ONE class before it stopped working, it would refuse to turn on/off when needed. I had to send it back still on bc it would NOT shut off but when I needed it on in class it would not turn on. Don't be cheap on this one spend the extra little bit to get yourself the clicker two so you can see the answer you sent on the screen, see that it sent, etc. You don't want to have to sit in class and wonder if your clicker is even working when your prof uses them as a participation grade! You will have multiple classes to use it in and if your nice to it maybe you can sell it when your done but even so its worth it to have something reliable.",1
"This is the third year in a row that I have bought a Dilbert page-a-day calendar. I love the Dilbert comics and being able to wake up every day and read one in the morning is very enjoyable. It's always good to start your day with a smile. I loved the Dilbert calendars I used for the past couple years.

However this years calendar is beyond horrible. It looks like it was designed by a three year old and was then outsourced to China for printing and assembly. I will explain:

1. Craftsmanship - When I got the calendar in the mail, I took it out and tried to set it up. The cover and binder promptly fell off the calendar, it now has the glue backing that the pages are stuck to exposed on the top. Since the calendar attached to the plastic stand with sticky glue on the back cover, the calendar doesn't ""stick"" to the plastic stand anymore, since it only has the glue and pages left.

2. Where's Sunday? - For whatever illogical and inconceivable reason, they removed Sunday from the calendar. They combined the weekends into one page, so now you have pages for ""Mon"", ""Tue"", ""Wed"", ""Thu"", ""Fri"", ""Sat/Sun"". I can't understand why they did this. The whole reason I use page-a-day calendars is because I can never remember what the date or day of the week is. It is only through the habit of removing a page every morning that I have any clue what month/day/year I am living in. I'm serious. I don't keep track of time like other people do. So combining the weekends like this really throws me off.

3. The Font - The old Dilbert calendars had an easy to read font for the date and day of the week. They used a bold black font on a white background, something that everyone is accustomed to and can read easily. Now they have a thinner black font with a white highlight on a lime green background. It actually is harder to read, especially when you wake up in the morning. The obnoxious orange seal on the bottom right of every page with Scott Adams name only adds to the visual aggravation.

To conclude, the calendar is in almost every way horrible. I love the Dilbert strips, and the strips are the only enjoyable thing about this. I will be shopping around for another page-a-day calendar to use, and probably won't buy another Dilbert one. I think one of these days when I am bored I will go through and read all the strips in this one, and then throw it out.",1
"Spend 15 minutes on the internet, and you will find all of these ideas and more for free.  I feel very foolish having paid for this book and hope to save others doing the same.",1
I received this book of file folder games and it looks like the back cover and several file game pages have been sliced through and ruined with a knife or another type of cutting device.  Sad cause three of the 20 games are ruined.,1
"This is a great idea in theory, but only a week after we got it it started acting crazy and would beep all day and night. It has the tiniest screw in the back to access the battery, so we couldn't stop the beeping. Eventually it died and my daughter didn't even really get to use it.",1
Kitchen timer works better than this. It was a waste of money for us.,1
Too much trouble.,1
"Can't make these match up with catechism I purchased.  Not all catechisms are the same. Ordered with ""Cathechism of the Catholic Church"" and they are screwy with that edition.  Came as recommended but don't fit the bill.",1
"Not only did this burn the hell out of my eyes, but it did absolutely nothing after a 3 weeks of nightly usage. No lash growth and definitely no eyebrow growth. If anything, it was sticky, and my eyebrows fell out. Strange.. I've used other products in the past that worked well on lashes and didn't burn.. That product sadly is discontinued.",1

"$11.95 for a password keeper- expensive but had a leather-type cover & looked good!
Opened it up to the 'A's"" & put in my password info......turned the page to the next section & all of the pages fell out!!!!!
Also found a small metal piece in the binding that was loose & would have choked a small child or dog.
I want my $ back
Thanks",1
"These are worthless! The print is too small, the quality is bad!",1
Very streaky. It does not draw cleanly and the ink doesn't flow easily most of the time.,1
"I was expecting a pen that would write better and more consistently, but unfortunately they write muddy lines that tend to skip or stop writing altogether. The colors are also more faint than I expected. They are made cheap and leave ink all over the tip of the pen. For the price, I wouldn't recommend them. They seem more like a novelty that would be at a dollar store.",1
So disappointed with the way the ink does not blend,1
Overall did not write that well!,1
"The Tutti Frutti Gel Pens that I received are sub-par.  They are not scented, the ink flow is horrid -- either skipping or flooding & they only work when held straight up/down.

Packaging was great.  Cute to look at.  Just not worth using and can be frustratingly messy.",1
Cheap and don't work,1
"I've heard a lot of people say The Argyle Sweater is like The Far Side. Um, no.",1
Be warned:This is one page printed over and over 180 times and 2 other pages. Not worth it.,1
There is too much packed on each page. Not enough room to use productively. Too busy.  The cover curls backward  into a roll.,1
"The calendar is a disappointment. As soon as I removed the shrink wrap, I realized the cover has already been damaged. The prints are of low quality. Dull, the colors of the images are not even close to what is showing on the webpage. The national parks are breathtaking (I've been to quite a few of them featured in this calendar) but most of these pictures are simply ugly.",1
"I bought these because I bought the first one.  However, these were not the same quality tangles that the other set was.  It's like she was searching blindly for patterns to put down.  Wish I didn't buy these.",1
"These have very weak magnets, barely holds on.  I don't like them at all.  I thought they would be more like an Olyi clip and be much stronger.  They barely hold 1 piece of paper.",1
Was bent when it arrived. Had a crease in it.,1
One of them was bent when it arrived and had a crease in it.,1
If I could I would give this zero stars. Its a cardboard with a tassel on it. And it came all bent up. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,1
I bought this bookmark because I loved the moon design but when I got it the image had melted off! The design was the only reason I bought thist and now I'm stuck with smudged bookmark!,1
Utter crap.  First of the two refills didn't work right out of the package - no roller ball in the pen tip.  The second one is rough and uneven.  You get what you pay for - and I paid for crap.  Don't waste your money.,1
"After reading all the reviews mostly praising this roller ball refill I purchased the pen and a package of refills.  The pen okay, nothing special but the ink was horrible.  There was no flow at all...skips constantly....I tried all of the refills just make sure I did have a lemon but they were all the same.  I very recently bought several journals from this company and found them to be the best ever so I felt confident....

 I am a pen person, never written a review before but felt this was too bad to be true.  The very best refill i've found and been using for years is the Schmidt...the make refill for every pen from not expensive to top of the line pens...they write like a dream and last for a long time.  I highly recommend the Schmidt for any pen you are thinking of buying.  After all it's the ink that matters.  The pen is just the container.",1
"Very small in size,would recommend a size or 2 up from this one !!",1
Not as described.  Mine came with W T F on the top instead of PRESCRIPTION and for that reason I had to throw it away.  On the positive side I was refunded my money.,1
Not enough space to write and I don't buy all the crap listed on this page. Plus the page is huge with no space to write.,1
"They are not sticky enough to stay in place, even temporarily.",1
The notes were bent and they were not sticky at all.,1
Totally over priced.  One tiny pad of High Five and that's it. Very disappointed.,1

Not worth the price..",1
"DO NOT BUY, IT IS MISSING DAYS OF THE WEEK",1
"I'm a huge fan of pretty much anything paper related as I make all lists, plans etc the old-fashioned way - and Knock Knock pretty much has the market cornered to a T. Not only do their product cater to whatever function, interest or humorous penchant you might have, the paper is also excellent quality - not flimsy like other I've bought. I own probably about a dozen different variations of this particular type of product (meaning the size) - ranging from the basic to do list to packing view decision-making etc. I also have post-it versions and smaller lists. To date, none of these Knock Knock notepads have ever let me down and as a product I would rate them a solid 5/5 without hesitation.

This review is for the WHAT I ATE pad.

The fact that this pad is currently marketed on Amazon for more than TWICE the regular retail price of $6.99 (at the time of my writing it's at over $14!) is absolutely ridiculous - hence my revised rating.

I would also point out that the spaces are VERY small and limited; so if you take anything like dietary supplements or want to keep a more detailed account of what you're eating, this simply isn't going to cut it unless you have tiny, diminutive hand-writing, this is just useless unless all you're writing is single words in each space. Not one of Knock Knock's best.",1
These are super tiny...not worth the cost.,1
Wish it was sticky!!!,1
I bought this thinking it would be nicer than it is.  I mean this is a scratch-pad for eight dollars and  some change.  Something you would find at the dollar store.  On top of all-it is a present!,1
They are very flimsy and cheaply made.  Alai you can not peel and re-adhere then to other surfaces.,1
"I gave this as a gift to a few people and they all loved it.  It is an easy read and leads one to believe it will be a nice introduction to helping a person build a relationship with Christ. What is does for many people is it replaces time in the Bible with the reading of this book. After a careful read my self I see that, Sarah Young, perhaps wanting a word from God that was more than the Word of God, she ended up being deceived herself. ""Deceiving and being deceived: 2 Tim 3:13, and she has taken millions of Jesus Calling readers along with her. Remember I Tim 4:1 "" Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons."" The writer has made millions of dollars by steering people away from the Word of God (the Bible) and towards Jesus Calling. An example of a misrepresentation that I found on two separate pages that contradict the Bible's true Jesus Christ.  Supposedly she was told by her ""Jesus"" that the last words he spoke after his resurrection and before ascending into heaven were ""I am with you always.""  But the statement made by the true Jesus Christ on the Mount of Galilee were not His last words before ascending into heaven.  His last words were spoken from the Mount of Olives as recorded in Acts 1:7-9, 12. The 2 messages Sarah Young received from her ""Jesus"" contradict the words of the true Jesus Christ in the Bible. Regardless of whether the writer has been listening to a deceptive spirit (I Tim. 4:1) or to her own confused thoughts (1 Corinthians 14:33) or a combination of both, she is misguided and is in turn deceiving others (2 Tim 3:13) whether she realizes it or not.  Believers must search the Scriptures for themselves to see if the things they are being told are really true (Act 17:11) and they must test the voices they are listening to ""because many false prophets are gone out into the world"". 1 John 4:1).  It is not enough that a teaching makes a person feel good if it is not based upon the truth of the Bible, then it is to be avoided.  Unfortunately, believers who are not well versed in the scriptures will not be able to catch untruths and deceptions when presented to them. It is my prayer that readers be more discerning and work to recognize God's truth from man's almost truth.",1
"What a horrid little journal. No binding strip on the the left side, which holds the pages inside the book. For this price they'd couldn't be bothered with a strip? Pages are barely sewn in. Cheap cheap cheap.",1
Extremely upset. This package did not come with all it said it would. There was a sheet missing or something. I did not receive any days-of-the-week label cards or the number 1. These things are kind of necessary for the calender's use....,1
"The stencil looks pretty, but it really doesn't produce what is pictured. With all the holes, it produces a very difficult-to-see flower. If you study the stencil a bit, you can see that you really need the opposite of what has been produced. Furthermore, you have to use the entire stencil because there is no way to do the edges to capture where the flower ""ends"" unless you do all the adjacent flowers. This is about 8 1/2 X 11 stencil and just too big to do smaller work. Trying to single out a particular flower is impossible since there is no produced ""border.""",1
"My biggest gripe - I failed (my bad!) to read the full product description, instead relying on the short description printed next to the item, and did not realize the calendar commenced in August of 2014. I would not have purchased it if I had known this. I had assumed I would ""lose"" January-June, and still have 11 months remaining...instead I will only get 9 months of use out of the thing  - and for the price I paid that does not seem at all fair.

Additionally, if I had read the reviews - which I normally do, but in this case I thought ""how bad can it be? It's paper with dates and boxes on it, right?"" I would have noted that it is indeed an anti-American piece of....work. As the daughter of a recently deceased veteran I am insulted by the absence of a Memorial Day sticker. Cinco De Mayo is here, all right, along with Labor Day and Earth Day, Grandparent's Day and Ramadan - not to mention TWO each of Thanksgiving, Halloween, Columbus Day, Christmas, New Years Eve, Kwanzaa and ""Hannukah begins"" (because Hannukah starts twice?). But no Memorial Day? Really?? Not acceptable.

Returning is very tempting, but unfortunately I bought it because our schedule has gone completely nuts and I just plain don't have time to sit and wait for another one. So I will keep it, use it, be grumpy at it, and NEVER order products made by Orange Circle Studio again!

Edited to add: I just scanned through the stickers and there are NO stickers related to any of the holidays honoring our veterans or our nation. No Veterans Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day....nada. Now the stinking thing is going back.",1
"Just bought this.  If I hadn't already written on it, I would take it back.  This product is a huge slap in the face of every veteran and every true American.  There is a ""Cinco de Mayo"" sticker, but no ""Veteran's Day"" sticker.  There are no stickers for other holidays in other countries.  Cinco de Mayo is a holiday of great significance, in Mexico; it is merely a partying day in the U.S.A.  Shame, shame, shame on Orange Circle.  On the usefulness side, only 10 months will stuff under that plastic holder; you'll never get 15 pages under it unless you chop the older pages out.",1
won't print,1
Too small and pricey,1
"I'm not sure if I purchased the wrong one or what but these were missing some books (I wanted the Catholic version).  Also, I received two of the same sheet of labels and was missing one sheet.  Unfortunately I didn't realize until halfway through installation.
If these had worked and been a complete set, I would be thrilled as the quality and ease of installation was great.
I did not try to reach the seller.  I ended up going to the book store and paid a little more for another set.",1
OMG I laughed when I opened this up.. for the price I was so disappointed .... this is super small,1
Cheap material. The pockets are  cut and sewn in a way that it is a struggle to get files in. Cheap stitches and poor construction all around. Very disappointing. Save your money!,1
"I would rate it 0 stars if not for the fact it does have slightly thicker paper and that it has a somewhat solid feeling cover.

Everyone keeps recommending these things, so I thought might give it a shot. I normally use handbooks (much better at taking inks), or cheap assed MUJI books (cheap as s***, flimsy pages, BUT STILL takes inks better than this piece of s***). Since everyone keeps raving about moleskines, I thought I'd get this one since it supposedly takes wet media better. Big mistake. It can't even take dry media much the less wet media...

I've let just text sit on a page for nearly 5 minutes and it still doesn't get absorbed, causing smears all over whenever. There is a reason why it's called a ""sketchbook"", to be able to quickly sketch out ideas and words without waiting forever for the damn ink to dry....

I normally draw with a combination of rapidographs, microns, MUJI gel pens, and pentel pocket brush pens. With the exception of the brush pen, everything else takes almost instantaneously.

With this piece of s***? It's actually been hours since I put ink on the page and when I touch it, it STILL smears... This is NOT a problem with the ink or the pens, because I have used these on multiple other sketchbooks...

Seriously what the hell moleskine, if you're gonna charge a premium on your books, at least make them not be useless piece of trash...",1
"I've always equated Moleskin to top drawer quality, but having received this notebook, I am absolutely shocked and appalled. Cheap cover material and paper weight so thin, ink writing likely would bleed or show through. Completely disillusioned. Returning post haste.",1
"My last three Moleskines all had manufacturing quality issues. My new one, less than a day in use, just came apart at the binding. On my previous one, the ribbon came out about half way through, and the quality of the outer material was noticeably lower than on previous books. I'm getting the distinct impression that with the rise in popularity the quality is taking a nose-dive, and that what I'm getting now when ordering a Moleskine is no longer worth the price. Based on my recent experience, I was already weary before placing this order, and I'm pretty disappointed by what's happened to what used to be an exceptional item. Time to look elsewhere for high-quality notebooks.",1
"Ordered two for a project--one was great, the other's pages were creased crookedly making it unacceptable.  Unfortunately I didn't open the shrink-wrap and inspect these quickly enough to use Amazon's guarantee.  Spent an hour online, took photos--everything, but the maker's website customer service was impossible to navigate.  Never heard from them, don't think the complaint got through.",1
"The only good thing is the cover, and the paper make me feel nothing right.",1
"I purchased this moleskine journal at Barnes and Noble but unfortunately I can't take it back. Every pen I have bleeds through! I even users like 5 different brands and types of ink. ALL bled through. The paper is practically transparent. If you look at my photos, one of them you can see a 2016 written. That's on the next page, not even on the back side. I could not write on the back pages and I would still see through the pages. I'm severely upset that I paid $20 for a journal that has paper worse that a $1 comp book at Walgreens. Whoever is in charge of Moleskines quality control needs to go. Quality is getting horrible.",1
"This notebook is actually a pale purple, not a vibrant color like the one shown. So bummed. I love moleskines (I use them exclusively) but I am super disappointed that the color is so off",1
"These were my favorite notebooks to sketch and write in.. But the quality of these are not the same anymore. The paper are extra thin in comparison to my older moleskine I've had for over 10 years ago. I seriously see-thru. I used a 9h derwent graphite pencil to light sketch and it left a indentation on the other side of the page. I used a micron pen to do some line drawings and it bled through the page instantly. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU MOLESKINE?? I was so excited to get this, but it's almost unusable - i can only draw on the cover. From some research, it looked like the company outsource it's manufacturing from Italy to Vietnam, but kept the prices at premium for these books. The quality dropped but price didn't. This generation of notebooks are probably rated as printer paper.",1
Didn't realize until later but it came opened.,1
"Despite saying that it allows for a light watercolor wash the paper still buckled when I tested the claim. I will probably use it with ink and pencil but I'd recommend using watercolor minimally or not at all. Not what I expected unfortunately.

Continued to try it for different things other than watercolor, and found it lacking. The size is good for brief sketches in pen or pencil. Do not use watercolor, it won't work very well, copic markers bled through the pages. So overall it was a big meh.",1
"I love moleskine notebooks, BUT NOT THIS ONE! dunno why, but the paper was very thin and floppy. markers bled through 3 pages! the colors looked dull and dusty. I gave up on it, which is something I don't do often, but it was useless.:(",1
"Not impressed with the quality. Which I thought was supposed to be guaranteed. I cannot return , so I lost the money.",1
Very Disappointed. Ruled lines are very faint and hard to see. Must have run out of ink. Not very many pages either. Wont order these again.,1
Came as expected - Just what we ordered!,1
It seems that Moleskine quality is hit and miss these days. I ordered 2 of these notebooks and unfortunately they were both duds. The paper quality is REALLY BAD. It's rough and thin and cheap. Moleskine paper is supposed to be a bit thicker and smooth and silky. It seems the only reliable Moleskine products are there planners. The paper in those always seems to be excellent. (See my review of the softcover ruled pocket size for more details of my bad experiences.) I've given both of these large notebooks to my husband to use since he could care less about what kind of paper he writes on. I'll never buy a regular Moleskine notebook ever again.,1
"These little note books are very handy, I would like to see better quality paper, I often have it tear from just writing with a ball point pen.  I do like the size and does have plenty of pages for all I need.  Darrell",1
"I tried this notebook and was very disappointed.  The paper is really thin, and buckles quite easily.  To use it effectively with watercolor paints, you have to make sure that you don't use too much water, otherwise, there will be so many buckles in the paper that keeping the notebook flat with the elastic, will not help very much.  That sort of defeats the purpose of using a Moleskine.

I use Moleskines for drawing with pencil and Sakura ink pens.  They do not stress the paper and the artwork looks really good.  If I want to use color, I use colored pencils or oil pastels, nothing wet.  If I am using watercolor, I carry the Strathmore watercolor notebooks, (Visual Journals), that come in 90 lb or 140 lb weights, - ""real"" watercolor paper, that delivers results without the buckling.

As happy as I was to see Moleskine watercolor notebooks, after trying them, I went back to the Strathmore books, and will remain with them unless and until Moleskine decides to put ""real"" watercolor paper into their otherwise fabulous books.",1
"I don't know if I got a ""lemon"" of a pen or what but this brand new ""Bible Study Pen"" that I purchased at Family Christian is not worth a dime.

EVERY color is not writing smoothly. I have to go over the same spot over and over and over just to get one simple little line. It really makes studying my bible and doing my devotionals frustrating instead of fruitful. :(",1
the markers DO bleed through the pages of the bible.  Would not recommend these - get the crayon type instead,1
"They're too light to be used for highlighting.  Don't buy them, you'll be unhappy. I acn't imagine why I have to write six more words.  I hope this is enough",1
"I ordered one of these and it shipped very quickly.  Unfortunately it was completely damaged due to the terrible cover material they use on this expensive planner.  Don't waste your time or money, this is a cheap planner which won't last the year due to the thin cardboard mateterial they use on the cover.  There are no tabs, just paper in the center.  Very dissapointed in this after all the great reviews.",1

"Poorly designed and all togeather impractical, basically a waste of $20. The days of the week are so narrow that you can't even write a single word. It has the days plotted out by hour, which is impractical when you need to jot down a list of things that need to be accomplished. As a student Saturday and sunday are extreamly usefull days of the week, but the planner just gives them tiny sections. I threw mine away after I bought a $5 one from my college bookstore, hopefully it can be recycled and provide some use as paper towels.",1
The stickers rip on every one which make them unusable.  Terrible item.,1
Hated them. They were so cheap looking and difficult to put on so i didn't. I would never have bought them if picture had not been misleading. Not worth putting on my Bible. Don't buy them get ones that are not so flimsy.,1

"I bought this product because I needed a pen in that category and because of the comments were good, but the ink was a deception.

I used only approximately 2 weeks and already the ink ran out , it's means the ink comes almost empty, because it's not possible that a new pen, which is given a moderate use, the ink ran out so fast.

I understand that marketers should do this warning about the length of the ink because nobody wants to buy a pen that in 2 weeks it will eventually run out of ink, unless they don't want to give that information on purpose to force a new purchase ink or that it is a mistake.",1
"Just received my pen today. Feels cheap compared to one I got from my father years ago, and from one I got on Ebay. This one Feels total different the metal is less in thickness and the screw on portion feels like it will strip its self in a matter of months. Not smooth and well machined like my old one or the Townsend I bought. I won't be buying one again will get them on EBay and make sure of where they are manufactured.  I am told that they will all say China or Japan,
Sad they were like many things made in the usa A great product being turned to Sh#t for a buck.  I feel the customer who buys or who bought Cross would have paid the extra for made in USA",1
"I sold one thing and sent me something damaged and very different, me no good at all, the pen is damaged and the pen has several undidas parts and there is an engraving of a name that does not understand and it is assumed that I sold me as again.
It is a mess, one nonsense that cheated me
dolver not worth anything to buy.",1
"I used to love getting Cross pens when I was a kid.  I still have them too, the chrome ones, but lost my only gold one.  So I wanted to replace that one after all these years.  I was a bit hesitant after reading these reviews, but thought i'd gamble and hope that after a few years of getting their QC in check, the quality would return.  No such luck. This thing is like a fake Rolex.  All the points the other reviewers warn you about are absolutely correct.  I compared it side by side with my vintage chrome ones.  The cap does not fit right, the overall feel and weight is poorer, the clip feels thinner and weaker, the turning mechanism seems flimsier.  It's sad to see Cross stoop this low.  This is the reason ""Made in China"" has the stigma it has.  I'm going to have to switch to the Fisher Space Pens, made right here in the USA.  Do me a personal favor, and take the pen!!",1
"The pencil didn't work, and my husband decided he wanted me to return the set.  Since this was a present, I was late returning the set and got only a partial refund.  My fault for not thinking ahead about the return policy, but a big disappointment.  It made a special time a big let down.",1
"I own a couple usa made 1964 Cross pen and pencil sets which are the vintage version of this new set. This new set is NOT usa made like the old ones. Its chinese made, light and flimsy, and does not have the rose gold look. It looks more like 10kt gold filled. The inner barrel edges are not smooth, the two pieces of the pen don't sit evenly and required some sanding to fit right. The two pieces of the pen require careful manipulation to sit right. On the vintahe sets, the two parts always sit right together. I was disappointed when I sent in a broken vintage 14kt gold filled set to Cross for repair and they sent me this new set since they could not repair my vintage set due to lack of parts. I was disappointed. I sold this new so called ""new and updated"" set on ebay for 50 bucks which is 100 bucks less than the price of new. Thats how much i hated it. The person who bought it was estatic to get it for cheap, but hey, im sticking with my usa made vintage sets. Cross is not what they used to be, but i guess it just makes the vintage ones more sought after. Dont waste 150 bucks on this set. Go on ebay and get a used usa made vintage 14kt gold filled pen and pencil set for 60 bucks. You cant go wrong with the vintage ones.",1
"I have quite an extensive collection of Vintage Cross pens from the 1950's and 1960's.
I had a pen and pencil set of this Cross Century from 1976 that started slipping after many years of use.
So, I sent it in to Cross get repaired. Turns out they didn't have the parts so they replaced my pair with this new Chinese set.
I was HORRIFIED. It was so light and cheap, the two parts of the pen and pencil don't sit well together, the engraved ""grip"" mark is gone, its slipperly to the touch, and worse of all, NOT USA MADE. They're not the high quality pens they used to be.

I'm hanging on dearly to my 20+ vintage cross pens more than ever.
Do yourself a favor if you plan on buying this new chinese cross set.
Go to ebay and get a vintage usa made Cross set for 15 bucks. You'll love the high quality vintage usa made Cross sets.",1
"This pen is chinese crap thats slippery. Not what they used to be. I have a cross 3501 from 1967 and 1970 and the old ones are solid and heavy and usa made. I sent in a 1980 cross 3501 that broke and they sent me this as a replacememt and i am disappointed. Its slippery becsuse it lacks a grip engraving, the two pieces don't aline correctly and doesnt write as smooth. Go buy a vintage cross 3501 on ebay. I bought several used vintage ones on ebay because the older ones are high quality and a pleasure to write with.",1
"I ordered this pen by mistake .. I really meant to order the rolling pen, but bought this without trying it, and I HATE IT!  It's truly the worst pen i've ever owned.  I've tried the fine refill, the medium and now the broad, and they're all bad as far as I'm concerned.
Funny thing is, is that I consider myself a 'pen snob' and this was a big mistake.
I ordered a Parker not long afterwards and that is a far superior pen, but I'm stuck with this Cross pen that I'm TRYING to like, just because of the money wasted.
I don't know where I've gone wrong other than getting the ball point instead of the roller ball.
Please, stay away from the ball points.  You can buy cheap stick pens that perform better.
Can I give it zero stars?",1
"This model has Cross' ""satin chrome"", not the normal bright polished chrome.  You can look at it hanging on the wall of any major office supply store instead of ordering it blindly online.

""Satin"" is a nice excuse for what might otherwise be called frosted or sand-blasted.  It's that cheap-looking finish often used in low-priced products to avoid having to brush or polish the metal carefully, and when you see it in front of you, it looks like junk.

The Classic Century model (in all forms), sadly, is now a little rougher to operate than the old one my Grandfather had.  It's OK, but the two halves of the pen don't fit together solidly, and wiggle too much.  The polished model looks nicer with its brighter finish and neat grooves, but also costs twice as much.  This bottom-rung model doesn't even look nice, which is normally a major quality for expensive Cross products.

The Classic Century uses a standard ballpoint cartridge (not a smooth roller or gel), so writing with it isn't especially great either.

Being a cheaply-made Chinese product, this ugly ballpoint probably shouldn't cost any more than a couple dollars.  Thanks to this new entry in their lineup, we can see what fraction of Cross' income they expect to get just for their name.",1
"I should have listened to the other reviews. This calendar is cheap junk. It is made of card stock just glued together with a thin magnetic layer inside. Mine arrived with the entire left side separated, which meant that no magnets would stick at all to the left side of the calendar. After gluing it closed, there was still a section in which magnets would not stick and would slide to the bottom. It's just pure garbage. I returned it and bought a pocket calendar by patch products which will last for years!",1
"The standalone answering machine had its heyday in the 1990s. Digital recording, an exotic and imperfect technology, transformed it from a complicated tape-based machine into a flexible voice-mail system.

The technology has stagnated since miniaturization made it possible to incorporate answering systems into wireless telephone base stations. This GE-branded machine seems to represent a sad backslide.

The one good point is that it can provide four separate voicemail boxes. This is more than offset by several drawbacks:

--An almost-unintelligible voice-prompt system. The designer of that feature seemed to be aiming for ""robotic strict female voice,"" and did not build appropriate ""shoulders"" into each voice segment. The comical result is a herky-jerky delivery of voice prompts. It is further hampered by a low sampling rate; thus it is very hard to comprehend during a remote retrieval session.

--A computer-centric coding system for days of the week. The voice-driven time stamp system can tell you which day of the week a message arrived. But to SET the date, you have to know that the days of the week are numbered from 1 to 7, starting with Monday.

--A data-retention system that doesn't work. In theory, unplugging the machine from the wall (or experiencing a power failure) should not affect the system programming or received messages, as they should be retained in Flash ROM. Unplugging the power connector from the machine itself is designed to reset the machine--a desirable feature in the event that ownership is transferred to another person. In practice, forget retaining your messages when the transformer is unplugged, because the machine certainly will.

In sum, this is old technology, and it appears to have been realized by resource-starved wannabes who had little more than ancient parts, old designs, and a GE logo with which to work. There are almost no choices remaining for this kind of answering machine, but don't conclude that this one is still on the market because it deserves to be.

You would be better served to invest in a wireless base station that includes a mailbox-based answering system--and ignore the wireless handset if you don't need it.

"I purchased this machine because it has the most recording time and most mailboxes of all the consumer systems out there--I need these features for my business.  I also need the recording quality to be good, like your run-of-the-mill commercial voicemail system (or the old cassette-type machines) because I need to capture and edit these voice messages on my computer.  On the recommendation of a couple of reviewers in this forum who stated that the voice quality was great, I decided to give this model a try.

Well, this system does deliver the capacity, but I'm sorry to say that the voice quality is one of the worst I've ever heard on a digital answering machine.  It's the same problem that plagues all digital answerers: it sounds like you're hearing the message through water.  I have a puny, 4-year-old digital Radio Shack answerer at home that blows this item away in terms of voice quality.  (Unfortunately Radio Shack no longer makes answerers.)  In terms of the outgoing message, I tried recording it remotely by calling in (which results in a much better sounding announcement than doing it in the same room), but even that sounds crummy.

Sorry to be a downer here.  Don't get me wrong:  this unit may suit you for home purposes, but the quality--which I find to be at or slightly below par for digital answerers--is not at all acceptable for a business.

I am really disappointed with the state of affairs in the digital answering machine world (and regular telephones for that matter, but that's a whole other story).  Tape-based machines, which have far superior fidelity compared to these digital pieces of junk, are no longer made.  I am truly perplexed why we can't get the quality of commercial voicemail servers in a small package.  Are the makers of commercial servers are in cahoots with the folks who make consumer models to keep the quality down?

So, the bottom line is that I thought I could get away with not paying my local phone company $10/month for voicemail service, but alas, I have finally decided I cannot.  Just what this world needs--someone giving more easy money to AT&T for voicemail service.",1
Did not work - leaked toner all inside the printer,1
"Hope this performs as well as the last HP toner, and lasts as llong. And they added a compatible as well - I guess to try as a replacement product. - update to review --
I know it has been over a year since I bought this toner but I have printed fewer than 250 pages and the cartridge keeps getting the roller coated with toner - the wipers are all clogged with toner and the pages are all coming out with black shading covering almost the whole page. Wiping the roller with an optical cleaning cloth and turning the roller to wipe additional areas only causes the clogged wipers to add toner film back on the roller - terrible quality - I will be notifying other people on my review. I would avoid this dealer - this is not a quality product.",1
"This was supposed to be a NEW cartridge, on the outside label it states Made from RECYCLED parts.

"For quarter-fold cards, these are completely adequate.  In fact, Amazon's price and low shipping cost means that you'll come out ahead over buying at most retail outlets.
The product's major flaw is precisely that they  _are_ quarter-fold cards.  You'll rarely find a quarter-fold at a card  shop--especially not made out of heavy card stock--because they're bulky  and impermanent.  They're twice as thick as the more standard two-fold  cards.  And if you can fold them, your recipient can unfold them.  This  destructability fairly screams ""I was made on a computer in someone's  home office.""
So why do so many people buy this product?  I guess  because the sheets are the same size as North American letter paper, they  ""feel"" familiar.  Maybe, as well, the format is a hold-over from  the 1980s, when dot matrix printers reigned, and there was no other  convenient way to make cards but by quad-folding.  Or perhaps it's because  a two-fold card in the small invitation size is rarely (if ever) available  at most retail locations.
Whatever the reasons, your end results with  this product will look as cheap as the card stock costs.",1
"The picture in the ad is a real HP toner cartridge box, and the description says it is from Hewlet Packard.  However many of the items for sale are NOT genuine HP cartridges, and others are genuine, but refilled cartridges with ""NEW"" as the condition.

Let the buyer beware, Amazon is allowing clone sellers and refillers pretend to sell new HP cartridges with no clear indication of what you are buying from some of the merchants.  Kudos to the merchants clearly stating what they are selling, but shame on Amazon for allowing some merchants to make it look like they are selling the real thing when they aren't.  The picture is of a genuine HP product, this should NOT be allowed if some or all of the items are from third party manufacturers or are refills.

Let the buyer beware!

I use refills all the time, but the quality is not the same as new.  I have my cartridges refilled locally, and when they wear out (and they do wear out) I tell the refiller to keep them, and I buy new replacements (and refill those till they wear out).

Only HP manufactured new cartridges should be sold under this item listing as new.  A second listing for clone cartridges made by third parties should allow third party cartridges that are new to be sold as new, and all refills should be sold as used.",1

"My Cartridge squeaked and was empty of ink. My hp4050 said after I installed it, to replace it. It was low on toner. The box was sealed completely, so it must have been a factory screw up.

 Maybe buying from HP would the best choice even paying 2/3's more for it.",1
"The title of this review is harsh but, at the time that I purchased this cartridge, it was listed as ""new"" and the word ""re-manufactured"" did not appear anywhere in the description.  I was careful to order this one particularly because it was listed as ""new.""  When it arrived and I opened the bag, the cartridge was covered with toner.  I cleaned it up and installed it in the printer.  From the outset it left toner ""skid marks"" on every page.  Since it was a ""new"" HP cartridge, I called HP to tell them of the problem.  They asked me to confirm that the drum in the cartridge was green.  ""Yes,"" I said.  HP: ""It doesn't have a blueish cast to it does it?""  ""No,""  I said ""it does not.""  That is when they informed me the green drum indicates that the cartridge is not theirs.  I have purchased reloaded cartridges before and they are far better and less expensive than this piece of junk.  In reading other reviews, this appears to be a problem with Amazon and, while Amazon gave  me an immediate refund and paid for the return shipping, I am still disappointed.  The reviews indicate that most make the same discovery, but decide to keep the cartridge because it works alright, apparently not minding that they paid way too much for it in light of the fact that it is re-manufactured.  Someone is making a lot of money dishonestly selling these things as new and, since Amazon has the power to police this, I hold Amazon.com responsible.  So, Amazon, are you going to police this nor not?  By the way, I now have a new, genuine HP toner cartridge purchased elsewhere...",1
"Nowhere in the product listing is it stated that this is a used cartridge that has been drilled and refilled and repackaged. The toner cartridge I received was an ""Office Depot"" brand reconditioned toner cartridge and not anything connected to HP as the manufacturer.

"So, for some odd reason this cartridge is not working right. I though it was my printer that I even replace the entire Fuser assembly (waiting for this backordered item killed my return window) but yet it's still printing out bad. What is the problem? It seems to print a ""shadow"" copy starting at the middle of the page of the entire image/text. Seems like once the image from the drum is applied to the paper is not really discharged or remove from the drum, when the paper keeps passing by, it reapplies the image again. I printed a BLANK page from MS Word and the page came out 80% black. There seems to be a mark of a roller throughout the page and ink all over. It can't be a bad transfer roller since I just replaced it along with the fuser above. Problem is, I can't return it now and HP says I have to return it from where I bought it. It's unfortunate because this cartridge is nearly full and unused but I can't do anything with it.",1

It works for a while and then shows Pr Error; I reset it, but that only works for a few minutes.  I have been using the same HP 12C since I went to work for FDIC in 1986, almost 30 years.  I never once had any problem with it.  It has been a dependable workhorse, but finally gave up the ghost.  So, I'm incredibly disappointed.  I did, even though it came with batteries, order some new ones for a backup.  I just put those in and in the 10 minutes I've been using it it has been okay.  I am NOT going to be continually draining it with a dime in the battery case.  If I have to do that, I'm returning it.  I want to use it.  I don't want to think about it.

NOTE:  It is now 10 mos later.  I finally got it to work with a few quirks here and there.  But today it started showing only part of the display and I've finally had it.  I did everything recommended to try to fix it.  I went to Hewitt Packard and ordered a brand new one from them and it's only a little under $70 with batteries and free shipping.

"This is really a ZERO star review. I have used an old-style HP-12C for over twenty years and never had a problem. I used it through undergrad and two masters degrees, all in business, so my calculator got a workout. Despite looking a bit beat-up, my original HP-12C still works flawlessly. I was excited when the new 12C with ARM technology came-out (it is the one with two batteries). For the first year it was great and blazing fast but now it's not working well at all. Specifically:

1) The display screen cuts off the bottoms of numbers at least 50% of the time.

2) Some keys, specifically the zero, seven, and eight, do not register when depressed. When pressed harder they register multiple numbers on the screen.

3) The multiplication button often registers multiple entries when depressed once.

These problems have become so frequent that I'm correcting mistakes more often than not. It has become unusable. Do not waste your money on this Made In China garbage. The faster ARM speed (especially for IRR, TMV, and bonds) is great, but if one has to keep correcting mistakes the benefit is lost. You're better off buying an older model (with three button batteries) off ebay.

Luckily I retained my old college 12c. The new one is heading for the bin.",1
"Clearly this item was stored someplace in a closet for a long time. The included batteries had expiration dates on them for March 2013. They had corroded/degraded so much that there was a white powder throughout the packaging - see photos.

When I opened the package, the calculator itself had a coating of battery acid turned into powder form. Unfortunately at the time, I didn't know that's what it was. The calculator was also emanating an odor. I put it to my nose and whiffed. This may sound unbelievable but I subsequently must have inhaled some small particulates of the residue and my throat started to hurt within minutes. Long story short, I ended up calling the poison control center.

Again, I know this sounds crazy, but I have two witnesses. All this to say, buyer beware from this seller! (FYI: the calculator itself seems to be working fine and I would return it, but I needed it ASAP, so I will end up just tossing the rest of the packaging).",1

"Seriously, I hate this calculator. On my laptop, typing this, I can easily just touch the keys on the keypad, they depress, and without even looking, I know what is showing up on the screen. With this calculator, you have to slowly press each button, rather firmly, then look at the little screen to make sure what you typed actually showed up. When you are doing algebra, or even pre-algebra, you don't have the time to have to slowly do this. You jut want to type in the equation and check the answer. This stupid thing, I get the wrong equation entered half the time because I didn't press this or that button hard enough, and heaven help you if you press them faster than they can appear on screen. I imagine they are still using chips from the 1970s. Also, when doing homework, I want to be able to pick this up and start using it, but it shuts off after a minute, and you have to check that it IS on, and if not, turn it on! It uses solar power, which is fine, but I'm in a well-lit room using it, so why the need to shut off every minute?

Maybe I'm a little spoiled form using a smart-phone for the past 10 years, where every touch registers. This thing is like an old manual typewriter to me, and I'm looking around for a better one. Time after time I'm working on an equation and look and see that the ""7"", or the ""negative-sign"" didn't register. They sell these at my school's bookstore (for double the price as here), but I think it says something that the teachers and tutors don't use them.

So although I never had issues with my own TI calculator which I've had since high school (35 years ago) and still works perfectly, I DO have issues with this model which may be unreliable.  My daughter has since dropped out of engineering and I hope it's not because she was doing so poorly in Calculus with her defective calculator.  Ugh. I got her a new Casio scientific calculator and so far so good.  Crossing my fingers...

Original review: Great scientific calculator for my college students.  Love how you can move the cursor anywhere you want through previous lines of equations.  I just figured out how to store values within certain variables.  Love it!",1
"Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently, TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.

I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However, the calculator is complicated to use, and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore, the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.

At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there, and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead.",1
Too stiff!,1

All the envelopes are defective.  I will try to contact the company for new ones.,1
"I was very excited to purchase these to offer my clients greeting cards. But when I received these, I opened the paper and it is not card stock. I decided to go through the design process anyway and print out my first Avery card. Fingers crossed, I waited to see the results....

Absolutely amateur and they looked as if, well, I printed them from my home printer. You can get Epson Premium Presentation paper and make these same things for much cheaper and higher quality. These cards are much too flimsy to be taken seriously.  I am just so disappointed because I really love my labels from Avery.

If you just want something that is crafty and looks DIY, then these will do. I was hoping for something professional looking. Good luck friends! ....if anyone happens to find something better, please do let me know.",1
When you fold the card it breaks in half. The paper is a lot thinner than at the office supply.,1
"These were listed as ""matte finish"" what I got was plain thin  white card stock. False ad needs to be corrected if you want Matte card stock ""DONT BUY THESE"" AMAZON GET REAL....... research your products and read the reviews",1

I ordered this paper for my grandson to use for finger painting. The write-up says it is heavy construction paper. It is not. It is very flimsy paper and I returned it.,1
came in a plastic baggy looks used!,1
"It broke within 11 months of purchase.  I treated it very carefully and gently.  I used it seldom, maybe once a month.  It just quit working.  Thumbs down from me.",1
I ordered a black one! and they sent me a blue one! hate when that happens so frustrating!!!! gosh!!! pay attention!!!,1
"These ubiquitous texas instrument calculator that everyone thinks are so great are complete garbage.  Compared to 15c or 42s by HP this is not a tool, but a child's toy or just a piece of land fill luggage.",1
"I bought this calculator to use on tests and exams where graphing calculators are not permitted. What I didn't realize was that the finicky keys on this calculator would make it a chore to enter something so simple as a three digit number. You may have to press a button two or three times before it even registers on the display. It'll take you twenty seconds or more to simply write out a basic arithmetic problem. Even if you have that kind of patience, you'll really need to keep your eyes glued to the display to make sure you didn't make any errors. Save your money and buy a 4 function calculator.",1
"Received TI-83 Graphing Calculator ""used- like new"". product was approx $70 - STOPPED working by the fourth time it was being used. Seller would NOT do an exchange/refund (even though it was within 30 days of original purchase). Look elsewhere.",1
"I thought this would be exactly the same as the TI 30X I was replacing.  It is not.  This thing is a piece of junk.  I guess Texas Inst. decided to cut cost and quality.

You have to press the buttons two or three times for every keystroke and ensure that the calculator detected your input.  This HUGE bug makes the calculator completely worthless.  I've had free calculators that work better than this thing.",1
I wanted a Palm Vx because I love the looks but finally settled on the Palm 3xe for several reasons.  1)  The hassle of charging a Vx when travelling is greater than the benefit of not dealing with batteries in  general use.  And a cradle or more expensive travel kit is needed for use  with a second computer or travelling.  2)  The cost of Vx accessories are  too high.  I liked the 3xe because I wanted to hot sync my computer at home  (3xe travel cable is only $17 compared with $40 to $50 for Vx) with my  computer at work where I used the included cradle (free with purchase).  And 3) the bulk of the Vx cases made them as big as the 3xe with included  flip lid.  And this cradle is $20-$30 on top of the price of the Vx.  The  bottom line: The the nice looks of the Vx cost $210 more with all the  accessories like a case and travel kit.  Not worth it.  I'd rather have two  3Xe's.,1

This film cartridge for a Panasonic fax is defective.  Am in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement.  Seller has been totally unresponsive.,1
Dont get this unless you need something with an odor to overpower everything in a room. Smells like gasoline for days. Beware!,1
this is not comfortable at all.,1
"Not sure why this is so highly rated. The mousepad makes a crinkle noise that gets annoying after a while, and doesn't feel like gel. Buyers be warned, I'll be returning this for another.",1
"I bought one of these, and it lasted 6 months.  I bought another one because it looked slightly different but it was a cosmetic change only, the product quality is still zero.",1
It is ok in comfort - but stinks of rubber/foam/plastic???,1
Got mine today and found the wrist pad only half as high as it should be. It works ok but was a disappointment.,1
discomfort is worse with this pad,1
"I wish I tried before I went to my vacation. Just used yesterday, and until now it will never pop up. I cannot return it! Do not buy",1
My mouses went crazy wasn't able to control them.,1
Got this a few months ago already splitting. The top felt started coming off 2 weeks after buying this.,1
"Cheap cushion in the wrist-rest wears out fast, rendering it essentially useless.",1
too big...it is a great product but no room on my pull out keyboard tray to use this.,1
"the gel felt like gel for about 15 minutes and then sagged and started making a crunchy sound in the middle. Arguably it is a very low cost product, but I expected more with the Belkin name on it based on past experiences.",1
"Caused severe shoulder pain. Would not recommend. I wasn't sure the pain I started experiencing the day after using this was caused by this mouse pad, so my S/O tried using it and within 4 hours started having shoulder stiffness and pain. I believe it raises your wrist too high.",1
"OLD REVIEW: Love my gel mousepad. Only wish it didn't stain easily. Don't drink coffee by it!

UPDATE: I purchased a new one of these 11/11/2016 and it is no longer made of the same material. It goes CRUNCH CRUNCH every time I touch it. As if it's full of potato chip bags. Loud and annoying to not only me but coworkers as well. Shame on Belkin for taking a 5-star product and cheapening it. I'll have to find a different mousepad with actual gel inside.",1
terrible wrist rest wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,1
Very comfortable; nice size; but my optical mouse does not work on it.,1
"Great idea, but cannot move hand enough. Pad is soft, and would be better for a keyboard than a mouse. Donated to GW.",1
Sorry to say it started to flatten out within two weeks. The user no longer uses it and found no relief for their wrist.,1
"mouse doesnt work properly, Steelseries is the best.",1
This is not a gel pad. It;'s stiff foam. It's more annoying than comforting.,1
"Purchased this to replace an older Belkin WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad.

Those that have purchased these recently will have noticed that Belkin has changed the Wrist-Rest from Gel to Foam.

This change is not reflected in the product details.

My entire hand began hurting within days of using this product. There is a definite lack of cushioning due to the stiffness and non-conforming nature of the foam, compared to the older Gel models.

Seriously disappointed with Belkin over this change and not updating the product information. I would recommend you do not buy this and instead purchase a mouse pad with an actual Gel rest.",1
"horrible, makes your wrist sweat awful",1
Where's the gel? It's a cheap dollar-store mouse pad.,1
"Do not buy this product if you're sensitive to chemical odor! About couple of years ago, I bought the same product, it was fine, no strong odor. Ordered this one and it came with a STRONG chemical smell. I left it on my balcony hoping the smell would be gone after a week. Nope! the smell is still strong after I left it outside to air out, even after a week.

I really liked the product as it worked well and provide good support for my wrist (my previous purchase two years ago).",1
The hand rest is nice. but the pad does not work well at all with optical mice. it is noisey and the speed of the cursor is slowed significantly. i will stick with hard surface mouse pad.,1
"I'm a guy and frankly, not fussy about how things smell. I buy a new one of these every few years but this one is ""special"".  It fills the entire house with the smell of burning tires.  Not familiar with this odor?  You will be.  How strong?  I thought a drain backed up somewhere.

My hope is that this is caused by being sealed up during the long trip from China, and it will lessen in a year or two.  There must be a use for this type of chemical warfare.  Impressive, something so small can emit such a powerful, noxious stench.  Thank you, Belkin, for this enhancement to a perfectly satisfactory product.

Update.  Mousepad was exiled to garage for 2 weeks.  With the air circulation in the garage, the odor decreased from extraordinarily noxious to just very unpleasant.  Brought the mousepad into the house and I noticed the longer I used it, the more overpowering the stench.  I think I've figured it out.  The pad itself is made from the cheapest Chinese rubber they can get, so it outgasses.  Well, no surprise there.

But here's the secret:  the gel.  The reason the older versions had a mild odor was that the ""gel"" was fairly benign.  Users have commented the new gel doesn't feel the same and I'm betting that's because it isn't.  And whatever it is, when you apply pressure with your wrist, you pump out the stench (it's so strong, it makes your wrist smell like a burning inner tube but that's just a bonus.)

So back it goes to Amazon.  I threw the packaging away but I will seal in in a Ziplok bag and marked ""open only with protective respiratory gear""",1
"nah, too small",1
"Disappointing.  I thought going with a brand name like BELKIN, it had to bee good but I was wrong.  Question if it is really ""gel"" as it was hard as a rock and actually irritated my wrist.  Feel like hard foam.",1
"These kingston mousepads used to be *awesome*. Unfortunately, they changed the design and now they are garbage - the appearance is the same, however:

The wrist rest is like a rock. Has hardly any give to it at all. The old version had some give to it, and gently conformed to your wrist.

There also doesn't actually seem to be any gel in the wrist rest - just hard foam rubber. On the old one, you could feel the gel squishing around in the wrist rest.

The product is poorly assembled. While handling it, it is clear that the block of hard foam rubber that forms the excuse for a wrist rest is not attached to the sheet of foam rubber that makes up the bottom of the mousepad, and there is a visible bubble on the back where they should be attached.

What the hell happened to the good version of these? I need a new one, and all I can find is garbage ones like this.",1
Wrist rest pad goes flat after little use... and I have petite wrists.,1
"It fell apart in a few months, had to buy another.",1
did not work at all. sent it back and still did not work. the battery works so i am stumped with a expensive paper weight.,1
"Knockoff or ridiculously old.  The pad is hardly gel.  It crackles and crunches like cellophane stuffed into a fabric casing.  There is definitely no ""gel"" in that ""gel-pad"".  Don't buy it, save the money and buy something better. Too bad... it could be nice if it was the real deal.",1
Motor burned out in less than a month and stopped working.  This thing is also pretty slow; my $30 shredder shreds at twice the speed.  This huge ugly shredder can barely handle an envelope with junk mail in it; I have to actually open the junk mails and shred things separately or it will jam.  I got really ripped off by Fellowes on this one.,1
"My Walmart shredder finally died after several years of service.  Since I had a gift card for Office Max I purchased the PC60C-2.  After getting it situated on the basket properly, it whirred away.  I put a single piece of paper in - it ran for about a third of the page.  Had to turn it off and on again - about 4 times to get the single sheet of paper all the way through.  Resituated the cutter on the basket and tried it again.  Same thing - only works through a portion of the sheet.  The shredder is now packed back in the box and is being returned to Office Max this evening.  Maybe I'll go to Walmart and buy another of their cheap ones - spending $90 certainly made no difference.",1
I'm afraid I've gotten cancer just from opening this foul smelling thing.  DO NOT buy this it smells very strong of chemicals and made me sick to my stomach immediately.  I can still taste the smell in my mouth it is so bad!,1
"This seemed like a good buy, but the hand rest part where the palm goes has literally caved in.. It's like buying one of those never-deflate pillows and getting one that turns mushy after you use it for  a few weeks. This thing is piece of s***--period.",1
This mouse pad has a wrist gel pad that is extremely hard and actually hurts my wrist instead of helping.  The indentation in the middle of the pad is very uncomfortable.  Not what I expected at all from Belkin.,1
I had to stop using this because I started having wrist pain I never had before. I haven't read about this kinds of pads but now I have and I don't think they are well thought out. Maybe for people who only use the pc for a few minutes a day.,1
"I bought this to help alleviate some wrist strain when using my mouse. The pad has an existing depression already in the top of it and is not comfortable to rest my wrist on (not soft enough). I also find the pad restricts my movement of the mouse.  I'd return it, but it would probably cost me as much or more to do... so will count this one up to a good try, but lost (fortunately not too expensive). Would not recommend.",1
this mouse pad never made it to my home. It is a nuisance to have to repeat myself over and over again.,1
"The hand rest is sort of comfortable, but it doesn't conform to your hand shape. Reason: This is not gel. It has foam inside it. I didn't like the pad all that much, so I cut it open and well, there was foam inside it. Belkin, please don't lie that this is gel. It's not. I have uploaded two pictures of the pad. One of them shows the material inside the hand rest, which is clearly foam.",1
RETURNED,1
"This LOOKS like the original Belkin WaveRest (which cost $8). Looks only. The material is different. Not as fine or nice. The pad? Not as soft and gel like. Too lame. And what's with the bar under the pad? Why is that there? I can feel it under the pad. It's annoying.

I still have an original WaveRest from a decade ago. I'm using it right now. The way to identify an original is that it will have ""Beklin"" in which at the top with a white oval around it... just like the product image above; however, that is NOT what you receive. You receive a cheaper, inferior version sans oval.

Sorry, my friends. I am still looking for a replacement (or original) WaveRest. Out there somewhere there is one for sale, and I'm going to buy it. I'll let you all know if I find it.",1
"only .5"" high not 1.5""
fabric is not durable, wears through and hard to keep clean

other than obvious lack of function due to height, no leaks, does not stiffen up over time

Innovera is a better brand",1
If you are not required to use this calculator for your class I would recommend another calculator. This thing is horrible. Pressing on it feels like pressing on plastic keys on a child keyboard game. It is not solid it shakes all over the table when I utilized it. Horrible.,1
"This pad is comfortable but the seal that keeps all the gel stuff in the pad comes apart easily. I'd recommend looking for something with more durability.

Edit: I had to throw the mouse pad away because the seal came apart entirely and all the stuff on the inside started coming out. BAD PRODUCT",1
"This product is for real geeks only. I bought it as a souvenir and office decoration.
If you want something serious and practical, get an iphone (or any other smartphone) and a financial calculator app that can do Black-Scholes option pricing and many other fixed income and derivative stuff that this calculator cannot do.",1
"Did not work with my mouse. wrist rest is great but, have to keep another mouse pad over it.",1
"Busted open the second day.  Too much weight on it or a crappy product?  Maybe just a flawed item in the mass distribution?  Whatever the reason, it busted open (cool to see the gel stuff though :)  Won't buy ever again, though.",1
"UPDATE: After a couple of weeks my opinion of this has dropped. The only good thing is that it has the same nylon covering as the original version. But the gel (or whatever they use now, it used to be gel) feels as hard as a rock and is really unpleasant to use. I thought I could live with the thinner padding but this is really really unpleasant to use.

This isn't a worthless wrist rest but I'm giving it one star because Fellowes shouldn't be selling this under the same product ID (down to the model number) when it's significatnly different.

It is significantly shallower (in terms of thickness) and hence doesn't offer nearly as much padding. It's also shallower front to back.

This isn't a bad wrist rest (and they are much cheaper now: I paid roughly $13 for this compared to $18 4 years ago for the same product ID), but they are not in any way the previous generation.

Some people might consider this a better product as they make not like the height of the earlier ones.",1
"I have used a Fellows wrist rest for some years, both at work and at home....the kind with the cloth covering because I don't like the sticky plastic/gel coverings they use now.  I've loved it and have had NO hand or wrist problems since I started using them.  Unfortunately, the covering for my home rest had peeled free. I immediately raced out to order 2 more, just in case.  Well, forget about it.  If you can't get one of the old models, don't bother with the new version.  They're half the height of the old version and shorter to boot.  I had to put the two new ones back-to-back to get the same support with my old one, and even then they're not as softly supportive.  I'm SO disappointed!  I'd have paid $25 to get a rest as good as the old ones.  These are going back as soon as I can get to the Post Office.",1
I don't know why i didn't notice that it opens from that end. Its kinda awkward when you are using it and then go to open it to get more forms. the forms fly all over the place,1
My stapler jammed relentlessly even when using its own brand staples.  I had to get rid of it.  Reviewers seem to agree with me that Bostich is by far the superior brand.,1
not a fan of the paper. very flimsy,1
What a waste of money! Do not buy because these don't stick and they fall off a day later. Not worth your money!,1
"Waste, bought wrong style with same name.  My fault I guess.",1
"Must have been old... it was dried out.  The ""metallic"" letters looked faded.  Basically had to toss in the garbage.",1
ok,1
"I ordered the clear labels, and they would not work with the DYMO LabelWriter.  Put in white labels and it worked fine.",1
"They're not very sticky, and they come out curly from being rolled up in the Box for who-knows-how-long. They get curlier the further you get into the roll. So curly the first roll jammed about 2/3 of the way through ruining the ink strip. The next roll ran out of labels about a third of the way through. I'm already on my third roll. This is a very good label maker, but their labels suck big time.",1
This doesn't work very well. Very disappointing.,1
"I had been used to using a Brother label maker at work and thought this would be just as good. Wrong. This tape will print fine, but when it comes to peeling it off of anything it leaves behind half the label and ruins whatever it was on. I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone. I'll be giving my Dymo label maker away.",1
"Note that this is PAPER, not PLASTIC. Disappointed.",1
"Buy a real label maker, this thing just jams up and wastes tons of excessive label tape.",1
Cheap tape... falls off of everything! Do not buy.,1
not a fan of the paper. very flimsy,1
Not very sticky!!! I have this and it's peeing off everything.,1
Labels don't stay stuck!,1
Mine doesn't print anything which is immensely disappointing. Flawed product,1
"DYMO's ""activation code"" system is buggy and does not work reliably. Want to print postage on the weekend? You're out of luck with DYMO. You'll have to wait until their customer service office opens on Monday at 9am so they can ""activate"" an item you've already purchased. Well, at least until their activation system breaks the following weekend... This could be a convenient product, but the company behind it is a complete mess.",1
Jams up in labeler.,1
"I spent forever figuring out which type of Dymo machine I had and which refill tape would fit it, then choosing one to buy.  It doesn't work.  The 13 year old machine (seldom but cheerfully used) is still functional, but this replacement tape doesn't function correctly.  :(",1
"I've been using DYMO Stamps since they came out with their first printer.  Before that, I used Stamps.com.  That means I've been using their stamps for at least 10-15 years.  Well, guess what, they are now requiring you to buy labels from them or you can't print stamps.  I wouldn't mind buying labels from them, but their price is considerably higher than the independents: 1 cent vs 8 cents per label.  That's robbery!!!!!  Add 8 cents to the already high postage, you might as well not send hard mail!.
Keurig tried this with their new coffee makers and HP used to do this with their printers and they discovered innovative people would find a work around solution, or customers would simply dump them for other options.  This is precisely why I went from Stamps.com to Dymo...and now, I guess I need to look around for other options now.
I certainly wouldn't mind buying labels from Dymo, but once they monopolize the market, they can charge whatever they want.  1 cent to 8 cents per label....that's exactly what they're doing.",1
Useless. I can't actually find any software that supports this label. DYMO's own label software doesn't even include a template for this. Only monthly subscription services like Endicia or Stamps.com will actually let you use this label.,1
"Outrageous, unaffordable Extortion,  FORCED  mark-up on Postage labels supplies, Dymo  outlawed fair competition. 10-12 cents, for a penny adhesive label? $22.00 for a roll of 200,in addition, so many labels misprint, spit out multiple wasted blank in error, advance button easily touched, bad location to intentionally ruin labels, or voided for test printing as the roll gets unaligned kinked, so there are loss of many labels, about 25  that are wasted of the 200. So a roll actual yield about 175, not 200. . Cost of a 48 cents  plus up to**(((( 12 cents)))*** for waste = 60 cents for first class??? Criminal mark up costs.  After this roll is used, I will NEVER BUY and toss machine., never to be forcibly exhorted another highest priced roll again, additional 12 cents plus cost of prevailing postage is NOT reasonable to make any sense, even for convenience. .. Back to face value stamps for me. Dymo  UNETHICAL and IMMORAL high  price point will put them out of business! This is the worst  gouging I've seen in a consumer product, without any competition. Anti-Trust Laws are clearly being violated.",1
"Every time the US Post Office raises the price of stamps by a penny, people go crazy.

So, why would anyone want to print their own postage for 10 cents more, per stamp, than it would cost if you if you bought regular stamps?

Some people may say ""It's just convenient"".  Really... Is it that hard to buy a roll of stamps?  You can get them in lots of places, not just the Post Office.

Until recently, I was able to print postage using my Dymo label maker using generic labels, which were MUCH cheaper, but they now block you from using them by requesting an activation code from their more expensive labels.

The only way to use the lower cost labels is to pay them $10 per month for a premium account.  If you don't print a lot of postage, that's even more expensive on a per-stamp basis.",1
"I've used my DYMO twin turbo for years to do periodic mailings.  Now I'm hit with the requirement for an activation code.  My roll of actual DYMO brand 30915 stamp labels is old enough that it doesn't have an activation code so they want me to take multiple pictures of the back of the roll and of any additional rolls I might have, which I then have to mail into their tech support AND then wait for them to reactivate my DYMO stamp software to be able to print the postage I've already paid them for!

Saying that other brands of stamp media aren't satisfactory to use unless you pay them $10 a month for postage can't be legal.  It just can't.

This is the most blatant example of corporate greed I've personally dealt with in a very long time.  I hope that the company pays out millions in law suits and loses a big chunk of it's customers because of this.

Prior to this, I would have said my customer experience with the company, its products and its services was exceptional.  After 30 minutes on chat with their tech support while growing more and more frustrated, I would not recommend them to anyone.

Surely there are viable alternatives.  Any recommendations?",1
"Waste, bought wrong style with same name.  My fault I guess.",1
"Must have been old... it was dried out.  The ""metallic"" letters looked faded.  Basically had to toss in the garbage.",1
"Overpriced proprietary junk. Dymo/Rubbermaid forces you to buy their labels for the privilege of using their Endicia Stamp program. I went back to post office, No extra service charges Boycot DYMO!!",1
"Great label printer, horribly expensive stamp printer. Dymo is now requiring code to use stamps. Their stamps are incredibly expensive now making it wiser to drive to the post office for postage. Ultimately it will hurt their product sales. That is what they get for the bait and switch scam they played on their customers..Another example of corporate greed!",1
"Once a good product and customer oriented company.  Now, they are strong arming customers into buying their products for use in their printers.  Notifying customers to upgrade their printers for low costs and advertising free stamp printing, then changing the way everyone Prints stamps by requiring customers to buy their high priced stickers.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.  DO NOT BUY ANY ENDICIA/DYMO PRODUCTS.....",1
I had purchased some of the expensive labels and then bought some inexpensive ones.  I even made a YouTube on how to clear a jam from one of THEIR labels.  Now I have to give up on the product and demand that they buy back my machine or sue them in small claims court for it.  They're going to spend thousands of dollars on an attorney to fight a $250.00 lawsuit.  I guess there's some justice in that.,1
Slips in my Label maker.,1
"I've used Dymo stamps and labels.  They're ok, until you compare the price for the quality.  I bought Dymo as a label printer, not as a stamp solution, but the stamp solution was easy to use.
The new policy of charging $120 PER YEAR (9.95/MO) OR making me buy stamps that will cost me nearly $220 per year... well. thats easily solved.  Time to roll over the Dymo product to something else.
It will take 1-2 months for people like me to find a different solution.  And Dymo will loose customers like me that have been around since 2006 or longer.  I will no longer recommend this or any Dymo product as its clear that Dymo Management has their head up their proverbial keisters.
The simple solution would have been to partner with another label manufacturer that is doing it more cost effective.  This is a baby in the bathwater scenario and I haven't seen this type of open warfare on clients since the bank fees of 2008.

"Unfortunately, these labels are now much less in value for printing postage cheaply since Dymo made their postage software only compatible with their brand labels. If you use these labels, you must also subscribe to the paid monthly Dymo service and when you do that, the value of these labels vanishes!",1
"Not very happy because it comes off the plastic totes and drawers. I am having a meltdown since I had to go back to using duct tape and Sharpies during a major re-packing of household items due to a flood in the basement, and now that I have to put things back, some of the totes don't have labels because the labels are on the floor!",1
"I had hoped to use this in a 280 label maker.  It is not mechanically compatible and Dymo says that it is not functionally compatible either.  It has to be used in a special label maker for this kind of tape.  Too bad.  They did send me a replacement cartridge for my 280 (not fabric, but something so I hadn't wasted my money).",1
I'm sure it's great but it's not what I ordered and doesn't fit in my label maker.,1
This doesn't work very well. Very disappointing.,1

"I'd thought these would be the typical 23' cartridges, but at only 10' the price is pretty steep. I did like the neon bright label color, but not at a 50%+ premium.

The price-per-inch should have warranted a 3-star review normally, but these suffer from the same problem as many of the other Dymo label cartridges I've bought recently, the tape sticks in the cartridge and you have to pull out a bunch to get it to feed properly, so after finally getting the stupid thing to work I've pulled out a good 6 to 8 inches of this expensive tape. This is completely unacceptable!

Dymo really needs to get on the ball and fix the problem with the tape feeding or I'll be switching back to my old Brother label maker.",1

"The Palm V is the second Palm Product that I have owned.  (After purchasing a Palm Pro and experiencing numerous problems, I upgraded to the V, hoping to salvage my large database of entered addresses.)  And, for the second time, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the Palm Products.  BOTH Palm devices displayed the same problems, specifically:  (1) after a few months of ownership, the screen response begins to fail, requiring almost daily recalibrations of the Digitizer;  (2) many attempted recalibrations of the digitizer simply fail, because the screen become SO far out of alignment, that the user can NOT enter necessary menu selections to even request a digitization;  (3) attempted Full Device Resets become impossible, since repeated Full Resets begin to no longer properly reset the device; (4) as the screen begins to fail, the ability to enter keystrokes in the Graffiti language begins to decrease, forcing a user to rely on the screen's slow and tiny ""QWERTY"" keyboard; and (5) the Operating system still lacks simple security, such as permitting a user to set the device to automatically power off with a password lock (if a user wants a security shut-down, a user has to step through several screen strokes in order to EXPLICITLY shut the device off with a password...no automated lock is available on power down).",1

"The Fellowes is pretty much a standard cheap mouse pad, with fabric-covered neoprene.

Why didn't I like it?  We got two of these to go with some new mice we'd bought recently, and out of the packaging both mouse pads smelled terrible.  Acrid, chemical-like aroma which even weeks later is still noticeable.  We tried leaving one out in the sun to see if it made a difference, but it didn't.  I'm not talking a mild annoying smell either.  After working with the pad for a few hours, I began wondering why my eyes were watering -- and I'd gotten the less smelly of the two.

The other thing I didn't like about the pad was it was thicker than I would prefer.  I ended up spending extra to get an XTrac Ripper oversized mouse pad instead and it's da bomb.  For my spouse, I gave her my old rug-patterned pad, which I bought at a retail computer store a couple years ago, and she likes it fine.

I wouldn't buy this particular pad again, but if you need something cheap and nearly disposable, and you don't mind the smell, I suppose it'll do.",1
This was delivered without the starter pack and without the carrier. Had no way to try it out. Returned to sender.,1
"I am not happy with these protectors.  I thought they decreased the visability considerably, and a lot more in dim light.

I would pass on these.",1
Fellowes really dropped in quality on this one.  Had one from years ago that I was just replacing because it was getting a little stained and the fabric was comming undone on the gel pad.  This new one has a shorter gel pad that has much much less gel (not sure there is even gel in it).  So uncomfotrable that just my desk is better then this product.,1
This thing is a dinosaur at this point. Are they even selling it? I wouldn't waste my money on it.,1

This device along with a very nice leather case will be donated to charity.",1

"This is supposed to be an OEM Brother Toner Cartridge, but I don't think it is. The quality of the output is terrible--very light and faded. I had purchased it for my father-in-law's printer who lives quite far from me. After he installed it and started printing he was very unhappy with the quality of the print. I asked him to take out the cartridge and shake or rotate it a few times. He did this, but still the printing is very poor quality. It has now been over a month, so we cannot even return it, so we are stuck.",1
This was listed to fit a Brother 4100e fax. It does not and I can no longer return it.,1

Don't waste your money.

What's even more fishy is that the seller is changing names. I originally bought this drum from TONERIZE for $28, and its a bust. Tried again from CHAR's Enterprises for $58 and a NEW drum, but, much to my surprise, when I tried to link my prior order to Tonerize to leave this review, the item links back to here and my new order from Char's. Clearly something fishy going on. I intend to return the new drum as soon as it arrives. Going down to the Staples to buy a REAL NEW DRUM unit.",1
This item is not worth the money. Have to use setting of 1200 dpi to get acceptable coverage. At 300 dpi the printed page looks like a faded parchment. At 600 dpi there is spotty coverage with as much as one third of the page being too dim to read. Even at 1200 dpi there is occasional unreadable print. My toner is new and worked fine with the Drum Unit I used prior to this one.,1
Did not last very long.,1
"If it was possible to give less than one star, I'd do it. The only color it prints is an overall pink, which is okay if you're a florist who only photographs pink carnations, but I print real pictures. it spoils the experience when I print a picture of my wife in a bright yellow bikini, and everything comes out pink, including her. I couldn't wait, so I bought a real new HP cartridge. It was more money, but worth it. Returning it just isn't worth the trouble. If it isn't refillable, I'll toss it, and I'll know better the next time.",1
"Do not buy from BuyWTG (world to go). What they are selling is counterfeit. They will send you an ""OEM"" version, it's not in retail packaging. It will just be in plastic with a printed sheet of paper with specs. The label on the plastic containing the barcode (and stating it's from HP) is thermal printed. Same labels that are made from cheap label makers. HP never does this, theirs is machine printed. Test it out with a hair dryer, heat that label up and it will turn black.

The paper itself is crap, the ones that were sent to me are yellowish. The texture is so VERY wrong. It is not smooth and glossy. It's more like lustre/semi-gloss. Don't waste your time. Buy from a reputable company.",1
"It seems silly to write a review of something you can't choose. You either need this product or you don't. Still, one would wish, more like a dream than as a serious hope, that one day printer manufacturers might, like  pharmaseutical companies, allow generic brands of their ink cartridges.  Until then, I guess we're just stuck with being the victims of a  monopoly.
Nevertheless, there are two important things to mention, here.  The label ""C1823A"" has been supplanted in most retail locations  by ""C1823D"".  It's the same cartridge with a new suffix code.  Also, if you buy your cartridges in small quantities, you might want to pay  attention to the 2-pack version of this product.  It does offer significant  savings over buying them individually.
(The one-star review is delivered  not because there's anything inherently wrong with the cartridge.  If  anything, it's a spiffy technology that produces great results.  I just  resent that HP has a monopoly on my cartridge needs and no one at the  Attourney General's office seems to mind.)",1
"Really poor quality. Only red printed out, and that quickly changed to pink after about 50 copies.  I'm equally mad at HP for discontinuing the cartridge. This was a very popular size years ago, but their failure to continue production renders hundreds of thousands ( if not millions) of printers worthless. The environmental impact alone is outrageous. I also have a Canon printer, and it is excellent, as is Canon customer consideration. This sorry consequence is my reward for trying to support an American-based company. From now on, only Canon.",1

The pros:

"Apparently these out-of-date HP cartridges often have dried up ink.  The one that I purchased did not work from the get-go.  It would print only a faint red color.  However I have to give the vendor, psxpro, five stars for their outstanding customer service.  The day after I asked for a refund, I received an email from the vendor offering to either exchange the cartridge or issue me a full refund.  Retrun of the defective cartridge was not required.  Not wishing to experiment with another out-of-date cartridge, I chose the full refund, which was credited to my Amazon.com account the next day.  Not that is REAL customer service.",1
"I ordered an HP23 inkjet cartridge, and received an HP49 cartridge, so it didn't fit in my printer.  The ink also expired in 2007, and so it probably was dried up anyway.  I now see that lots of people have been complaining about receiving dried up ink cartridges, so perhaps buying off of Amazon isn't a good idea for ink.  I guess that it is why it is so much cheaper than from Staples, et al.",1
"The cartridge did not work in my HP 812C printer. It appeared to be refilled, rather than original manufacture. The printer's cartridge light was on, indicating the failure. The old cartridge still worked as always, except that one of the colors had run out.",1

"Supplier has recent history of bait and switch, my item was sold as OEM but was called next day and informed that the toner was not in original packaging as described, it wasn't even boxed - just in the plastic packaging it came in.  If you read recent reviews for this vendor you can see they have a history of this type of scam.  I can't verify the item is even original HP, which is what I was seeking and thought I had purchased.  Amazon was informed of this bait and switch vendor, just waiting to see if there is any outcome",1
"Don't waste your money, The PDA holder's three very flimsy support arms will not hold the PDA still, and the PDA holder will not stay up on its own. The battery life is very short.

"Sometimes you get what you pay for, but not this time.  I paid for a higher quality paper on which I would be able to print better quality images - and I didn't get it.

Using the same Epson R1900 color printer the same image was printed on three different sheets of paper - 20 pound copier paper, 20 pound bright white paper, and this presentation matte paper.  The test was run twice:  once using the printer's bright white setting and once using the printer's presentation matte paper setting.  The images on the high priced Epson paper was just as good as the images on the lower priced bright white paper and the cheap 20 pound copier paper.  There is no discernible difference in color or sharpness of the images.

Surface smoothness of the paper is comparable to that of the bright white paper.

Viewing the three papers side by side in sunlight reveals the Epson presentation matte paper to be as bright/shiny as the copier paper but not as bright/shiny as the bright white paper.  There was as much glare from the Epson paper as from the bright white paper.

Epson make fantastic printers, inks, and color profiles for them, but to date, I've yet to use an Epson paper that performs any better than less expensive equivalents. Maybe some day I'll learn to not even bother trying Epson papers.",1
Not what I expected. Have not found a use for this product. Perhaps I did not read the product description before buying.,1
"Not much different from regular paper, if only more brighter. Really overpriced, not worth getting if you intend to use this for party-related craft. Just get the Epson Premium sheets instead. You get lesser paper but its guranteed to work.",1
Paper curled up at the edges after printing.  This didn't happen with the same grade of paper but two-sided versus this one which is one-sided.,1

"Here's what's wrong with it:

* People are constantly telling me that they can't hear me --- the microphone is way too quiet. The phone does not use a standard 1/8"" plug, so you can't easily replace the headset with one that will work better.

* The light that tells you which of the two lines the incoming call is on does not light constantly when a call comes in. (It's only on where there's actually a ringing sound, but not between rings), and you have to know which line is active before you can pick up (there are two switches, one for each line). So, you have to sit and stare at the phone for several seconds until the light comes on before you can answer. I usually guess wrong when I just pick one or the other of the lines. There's no ""pick up whichever line is ringing"" button.

* It's very difficult to determine the position of the volume control. Since the control wheel is on the side and is very smooth, you can't even tell if you're moving it when you run your finger over it.

* The phone does not go off hook automatically when you start dialing, so you have to remember to select a line, first.

* There's no caller ID, which is obvious from the picture. I thought that this lack wouldn't be a problem, but it turns out that I rely more on caller ID than I had thought.

In all, the phone is pretty worthless. I strongly recommend against buying it.",1
"I've had this phone for about a year and have been unhappy with it from day one. I should have returned it when I realized that the flash button didn't work but now I'm back to buy another phone that actually works.  The listening sound quality is okay, however, callers often tell me they can't hear me unless I jockey the headset microphone right to my lips and speak loudly.  Having to locate the headset to answer a call is a real pain.  I don't think the description adequately explains the fact that you cannot answer the phone without locating the headset, untangling it and putting it on your head first to speak.  Also, the dialing tones hurt your ears when you dial with the headset on.  Other than that, it's great.  :)",1

"I have taught freshman college math courses for 10 years and thought it would be useful to give my perspective on this product (and why I think it is worth the extra $20-40 to get an 83, 83+, 84, 84+).

Students beware!  This product lacks several extremely useful functions that would put you at a severe disadvantage for a college math course that requires a graphing calculator.

Note the big difference in the buttons (compared to say a TI-84)
-No CALC menu (usually is above the trace button)
-No log buttons
-No e button
-Different wording / placement of keys will make upgrading to a college appropriate calculator very difficult.

The missing buttons are ones that I would typically use nearly everyday for a college algebra, precalc, or business math course.

Also good to note: many freshman level math classes do not allow the 89 or TI NSpire CAS for their algebra simplifying feature.  Some colleges do not allow for calculators at all, but I don't think that is so common, especially with the 100 level courses.  Be sure to check the course policy before purchasing your ~$100 calculator!",1

Tired of the gummy stuff (tacky gum, or something like that) I thought this would be the answer.  Well, I was wrong, and I've picked up and picked up various items that were supposed to be ""stuck,"" to the point of real annoyance.  I won't buy it again, but am still looking for the perfect answer.  If anyone has a reasonable solution, PLEASE post!  In any event, save your money.",1
"These are so tiny and clear it is hard to work with them; and, they don't stick very well.  I ended up throwing the product away.",1
"Awful. No matter what you are hanging with these, they fall sooner or later. Very frustrating.",1
"Not sticky, items fall of.",1
"Do not buy these on Amazon.  Item expiration date printed on box is Sept. 2016 and received this in June, 2017.  Printer test page shows no blue ink at all in the cartridge.  Piece of junk and vendors should not be selling these!  NEW cartridges of this type are great and have used them for years.  But they cost $20 more than this thing.  Believe the bad reviews of Amazon sellers on these.",1
Didn't work at all.  Had to return it.  They did credit me quickly.,1
"Revised review on Jan 4th, 2015...
Well, I ordered this cart on Nov 1st 2014 and installed it on Nov 7th. I haven't done much printing the last few weeks and certainly no significant printing that included color. I certainly don't print photos or posters. So here's my dilemma...the cart has run out of cyan (blue). Barely 2 months of minimal use on a cart is atrocious and I feel ripped off. I won't buy from this Inktronic outfit again but go to a bricks and mortar store for my ink in the future. Fool me once.",1
"First time I've ever had an issue with ink cart purchased thru AMAZON.
It was  received on time and in off the shelf physical condition. But when installed, it failed to  print.
I waited 24 hours to try again, due to extremely cold temps when delivered. Failed.
Then I manually cleaned the print head and the contacts. Failed. Then did the printer clean. Failed.
This obviously is a manufacture issue and not Amazon or their source fault.
HP cart returned with no issue.
Thanks AMAZON for making doing business with your company a pleasure. I will be back.",1
"I bought this Scotch mounting tape due to its touting of its statement of permanence which implies a very strong adhere.
Closer look of its description shows it will hold up only up to 5lbs with no mention of the tape area needed to provide that amount of hold.
In my application Im using tie mounts with  .75"" x .75"" adhesive square backs onto flat metal plates and wanted to use the Scotch tape assuming it was better than the tie mount adhesive.
Well unpleasant surprise, the adhesive backing that comes with the tie mounts is better then the Scotch Outdoor Mounting tape.
The Scotch Outdoor Mounting tape easily came up and provides weak adhesion.  Very disappointing.",1
"Will not even hold up a single sheet of paper . Manufacturer must be trying to get rid of a bad batch of tape ? I would not recommend this tape.  And, this tape is NOT RETURNABLE!",1
"I purchased two.

One prints only in black; the other prints
with lousy colors. Not true to color at all.

Do not purchase.",1
Very Disappointed.  This does not stick to the wall at all!  Horrible!  I will throw this useless tape into the trash.,1
Can't get the red cover off this tape. I had several other people try too. Wouldn't buy again or recommend.,1
"Too expensive, bought it because the 3M reputation but it doesn't work",1
"When I install a brand new real-live HP cartridge, it shouldn't have missing jets.

Even after I waste DOLLARS of ink doing Level 3 clean, it still has missing/clogged jets.  This is simply unacceptable.  HP needs to get their act together.

Now, what do I do?  Send it back to Amazon?

And what's this ""Singapore"" stuff?  HP spent about $1-billion making that state of the art robotic cartridge plant in Corvallis OR.  I guess Singapore manufacture is somehow cheaper than a FULLY automated factory?

"It worked great.. For a week or two, then the tape peeled apart revealing that it is really a few layers bonded together. I tried it with other applications and it still fell way short.

Eventually I went with Gorilla Brand and never had an issue. I would not recommend this product.",1
Horrible doesn't last long,1
"Very bad, my frames fell off and broke. Would hold up, DO NOT BUY",1
Doesn't work. Not sticky enough.,1
"I have no idea how they can call this extreme mounting tape. This performed horribly. Couldn't keep even the lightest thing up outside and it's supposed to be made for exterior use too.

I would never recommend this for any mounting of any size or location. I'm not sure what else is out there that's better, but I do know that some 3M sticky mounting strips I've used have stayed up outside for literally years through sun, heat, and rain. Wish I could remember which ones those were. Those are what I'd recommend instead of this worthless junk.",1
Not at all effective below 40 degrees Farenheit,1
After some day the tape detaches by itself of the boxes... useless.,1
"This product did not work. I attached a small lightweight solar light to my garage and within in a few days it fell off. I followed the directions very carefully, however, I do not think it could handle the rain and sun.",1
Tape does not stick!!,1
Don't waste your money this didn't stick to anything!  Not even a piece of paper .,1
"super cheap quality, kinda bent when i opened the nylon it came in, but did the job ok",1
"Junk! Not even worth the $3.95 I paid for it! It is very thin, weighs next to nothing, and the surface is not smooth so is noticeably noisy when moving the mouse around. I previously bought the ""Belkin Standard 8-Inch by 9-Inch Computer Mouse Pad with Neoprene Backing and Jersey Surface (Black) (F8E089-BLK)"". It is thicker, more substantial and quieter but after three months of daily use the surface is seriously worn! Apparently it is no longer possible to buy quality mouse mats like in the old days!",1
"I bought after reading several great reviews. In my case I am trying to hang up a sun shade in an aluminum framed screen porch. I used this tape to secure a command hook to the aluminum. The command hook tape lasted about 2 weeks. This Scotch tapes lasted about 24 hours. So, it did not work for my application. I am disappointed and stumped as to how I am going to actually do this, but it won't be with this tape.",1
"1 Star -  I tested a tiny piece that barely stuck to my wall so how could I possibly attach anything to it.

Totally Misleading Description!  Packaging said this TAPE could hold 10lbs - complete joke. I purchased both Scotch Permanent & Scotch HEAVY DUTY mounting tapes just to see if they were any good and what the difference  was. BOTH ARE WEAK AND BASICALLY USELESS unless of course you use them as a slight cushion and apply a drop of Super Glue on both sides to make them work.

TERRIBLE PRODUCT -  I'LL BE REQUESTING A FULL REFUND.",1
"Does not stick to cardboard boxes.

I taped up a box for USPS last night.

This morning when the mail man came for pick up the tape was peeling off every where.

Worse tape I've ever used.",1
Doesnt work....,1
"In a word: Sucks

I used this tape to mount a lightweight foam picture to my wall and it keeps peeling off.",1
"This packing tape is first of all... is very difficult to find the ""start"" on the roll. And, this tape is poor quality! It is very THIN. It does not stick that well, and then also easy rips while using it! I do not recommend.",1
"Don't buy it! Smells like Sh**! I am sure it is not good for your health!
It is also non-refundable / illegible for return. But Amazon is nice enough to give me a refund. Don't buy it.",1
"Did not hold my light weight dust mop head  to its holder.
I don't see how it will hold 5 or 10 pounds.
I followed instructions but I make no claim to be a handy man so perhaps  some human error on my part?",1
ok,1
doesn't hold as promised,1
tape failed. After taping 25 moving boxes 3 days later the tape started coming off!!!! Called to get replacement not sure if it's going to happen again !!!! :(,1
Changes review.. Actually had never  used  it and found that like others have said it won't  stick to boxes. Came loose  after a couple of days from moving box.,1
"Once I loaded 5 documents into it, it became apparent that only the first one was fully visible.  The other 4 were 95% covered and therefore not obvious - my oversight (got caught up in the marketing).  Second, its hollow plastic and once you load it up it becomes very top heavy.  I attempted to return it but realized it cost more in return postage than I paid for it.  So, I kept it but feel it has little, if any, use.  I would definitely NOT buy it again.",1
Never buying avery again unless I print through them. may work okay with things that are not edge to edge but fails at alignment a great deal of the time when your design goes up to the edge.,1
"It doesn't stick to anything but itself!!  It's a junky version of Scotch shipping tape.

Yes, it is thicker than most.  BUT, I have Staples brand shipping tape that is just as thick and sticks.

Soooooo, if you are storing and want to keep the box closed until YOU open it, wrap all the way around and back again.  Waste3 of tape.

If you are MOVING, get something else.  Else find your contents scattered who knows where.

I use a LOT of 3m products, especially automotive.  This does not act like one of theirs.",1
"Tape does not stick very well.  purchased for moving.  It doesn't stick to the boxes very well.  Started out double taping which meant I would have to go through twice as much.  Then I noticed after about a day of packing boxes, the tape was starting to peel off.  Heck no, wasn't going to chance all my hard work.  Just went to the office supply store to buy some real tape.",1
HORRIBLE,1
I bought 6 of these. A few work o.k. The others are junk. Half the time the end of the tape jumps back onto the roll after you tape one box. It takes a couple of minutes to get the tape free again. These are going right in the trash where they belong!,1
Absolutely worthless. Couldn't hold a banana to a tree. Why write such things as it can hold over 10 lbs or more? I rather have an ant hold it for me and it will do a better job. Unbelievable nonsense. Very very disappointed. Nothing Extreme about this tape. Only the extreme frustration it causes.,1
this is a joke. where do the people who built this get the balls to sell this at any price.,1
"This stuff is AWFUL.  We thought we were getting a better deal than the Scotch packing tape sold through Costco.  This stuff didn't stick on our boxes more than a few minutes in most cases.  This stuff is the worst packing tape I've used, and the whole pack was this way.

I would recommend a different version, as the Scotch tapes are generally pretty good.  Avoid this at all costs.",1
"I used one of these at the office and it is made with flimsy molded plastic.  The stand is too weak to use.  I'm keeping the other one because to return it would have been too much trouble.
Thanks.",1
"waste of money won't stick to anything comes right back of, don't buy",1
"These would be fine if the template Avery provides was worth anything. The only purpose for the template, apparently, is to install some malware toolbar (on the PC) and to waste sheets of paper.

Of course, this is practically the only brand anyone offers so Avery can do this kind of crap and get away with it.",1
Found that gluing the arm rest on was the saver so I bought this for no reason!!,1
This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money.,1
bought this before. it was rated 10 lbs. did not work. the 20# rating is fake.,1
"The labels themselves are fine. But since I've been printing serial number labels, I've been noticing the extent to which companies short you on quantities. This package, for instance, contained only 23 sheets, not 25. Petty chicanery, but extend that over many packages, and it's a significant ripoff that the company is committing on its customers. And if I hadn't purchased a second package just to be sure I had enough, I would have been majorly up the creek.",1
These labels completely jam up my printer every time.  They are useless!!,1
"TAPE WOULD NOT COME OFF THE ROLL FOR THE FULL TAPE WIDTH.  IT KEPT TEARING IN HALF OR IN SMALL SHREDS.  THIS HAS HAPPENDIN WITH 4 CONSECUTIVE ROLLS JUST PURCHASED FROM HOME DEPOT.  EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TRYING TO PULL UP THE SHREDDED PIECES UP WITH MY FINGERNAIL TO FINALLY GET A FULL WIDTH AND THEN IT TEAR AGAIN WHILE TAPING.
VERY POOR PRODUCT.",1
I taped up a box and placed it by the front door... then for the next three days all I heard was the tape popping itself off the box.  SO disappointed!  Not long lasting AT ALL.  I will not be buying this brand again.  What a shame!,1
"TERRIBLE!  This tape is sooooo thin I was scared to use it for the mailing I had to do.  I had to put a lot of extra tape on the box to make sure it would hold.  I wished I knew what my old tape was because it was so much thicker and stickier.
I would not recommend this tape at all.  Sorry I bought it!",1
Hardly holds anything of weight.  Good for sticking pieces of paper to a wall but don't try anything heavier.,1
"My GOODNESS!! This smells like trashcan mixed with a 90 year-old's bad breath! Belkin wtf!?
Decent price though :)",1
"Beware the 4-pack?  That's the one I got but you best check other reviews to see if it's all the options that are having issues.

Never in my life have I had transparent tape simply not stick. It's bizarre. Plastic wrap has more adhesion, it is that bad.

What do we do if Scotch botches it?",1
Download their software and could never get it to work as the label number didn't match anything on MSword... So I hunted and hunted on Word and found a size that worked..I wasted a ton of time on this and not to happy..,1
"It does not hold outside.  I tried twice to install a bell ring switch, but it falls off after a while.  I even try it on a flat non porous surface and it lasted longer, but finally the switch fell to the ground.",1
I bought this tape twice for moving.  The first batch was sketchy on sticking and sealing the boxes.  Since its Scotch brand I figured maybe it was just a bad batch or something so I reordered.  Same issue.  I'm very disappointed in whatever quality control or lack thereof this shows.  Don't waste your money on this stuff.,1
"Does not stick for more than 2 hours.  Constantly has to be smoothed down again.  Unfortunately I cannot return this for credit.  I must use it as best I can.  Perhaps it will stick to itself, therefore you have to use three times as much as you need to go around entire box.",1
"product inferior, tears in the hand and separates from packaging, NOT recommended buy another brand",1
These are great except that they were all bent in shipping. This caused them to get sticky stuff all over my printer and took many frustrated hours to fix. I had to throw out the entire package. Save yourself the heartache and buy at your local Staples.,1
"This tape is horrible. Within days, this tape peels off cardboard boxes. I have had to buy better tape to re-tape ALL my moving boxes, which is very frustrating given the time constraints of my move! I would NOT recommend this tape!",1
"This won't even hold up a poster. I tried and tried. I think in order for it to work you'd have to outline the entire poster in it and do the hokey-pokey.
Pointless.",1
"Purchased 3 colors (black, gray, red) for my business of personalized gifts.  Black was perfect and had good quality rubber backing.  Gray & Red have no rubber backing and are poorly made foam type material.  Not able to resell to customers.",1
"Does NOT stick to plain cardboard, causing you to use double the amount of tape!  Within hours, the tape had lifted off many of the boxes I packed and by the time I got them out of climate controlled storage a few months later, it had all lifted off the boxes!

Sticks well to plastic as well as  glossy cardboard boxes such as liquor boxes, however.",1
"Got this assuming it would be better for packing to move as it is moving and storage tape.  Don't waste your time or money.  Super thin, tears easy, and don't stick.  Takes double the amount of the regular shipping and packing tape.",1
"dont bother, its like using a piece of paper",1
The adhesive is poor. Doesn't stick well on any of the cardboard boxes for moving.,1
"i only by scotch brand packaging tape b/c scotch=quality.
very disappointed.
it took lots of manual pressing to get the tape to stick to the box.",1
Tape stick to my wall but still come off,1
Never buying avery again unless I print through them. may work okay with things that are not edge to edge but fails at alignment a great deal of the time when your design goes up to the edge.,1
Not sticky like other Avery.  Keeps coming off.  Also they got jammed in my printer.  It never happened to other Avery labels.  Returning.,1
"Total waste of money and time.  Moving across country and using this to tape up brand new packing boxes - and it doesn't stick at all.  Came down to find all the boxes we packed yesterday just about completely un-taped.  The tape is just ""floating"" off the box - both the bottoms and the tops.  Got more tape to re-tape all of the boxes and possibly repack some of them as they can't be turned upside down to re-tape the bottoms.  Will be sending back both the 4 pack that we haven't touched and the one that we already opened.  Disappointing and frustrating to have wasted time with this.  What happened to the ""Scotch"" brand?  Used to depend on it but won't be anymore.",1
"NOT GOOD! Item was exactly the size and composition as described. The feel is as good as almost any wrist pad that I have ever used. However, the chemical smell is beyond TERRIBLE! It is too bad to even use the item. I let it air out for a few days and the smell was just as bad. I let it air out for over FOUR MONTHS. The smell was just as bad. It caused me to cough and have breathing problems. I would NOT recommend this product at all. Even if you could stand the chemicals, how would you know it was good for you. Or your kids or co-workers.
Since I have had it for so long, I will just throw it away. The product is not usable.",1
"Opps, ordered wrong lable.",1
"Really disappointed, This stuff was thin,very thin,  That I could have lived with.  However......  Its adhesive quality was close to cottage cheese.",1
NOT A GOOD PAD. NOT EVEN POOR . DON'T RECOMMEND.,1
"The listing on this item keeps changing.  When I ordered it at the beginning of November, it stated ""DYMO High-Performance Permanent Self-Adhesive"".  Now over a week later, the title has changed to ""DYMO Standard D1 Self-Adhesive"".  When I view my order history, it states the first title (permanent), but when you click on it, it redirects to this removable/standard tape.  I received the standard removable tape that peels and falls off after a month or two, not the permanent that I ordered.  False advertisement.",1
Pure junk it does not stick.........,1
didn't work right :(,1
Really poor product! I am trying to use it to hold cardboard boxes together for moving... but it doesn't stick! All of my boxes keep popping open! Don't buy!!,1
"I ordered 45113 to replace the same item number I had.  Little did I know about the changes. Nor were they in the description!

Permanent adhesive?  NO.  The package says removable.  NOT what I wanted or thought I was getting.
My clear plastic module is replaced with a black plastic. No big deal.
The large curved area in the cartridge is now half the size.  It fits my older LP200, but may not fit newer models.  I don't know.

Just as another reviewer has mentioned, the label won't start itself out when you print.  They called Dymo; I did not.  I just did as they were told and ""assisted"" it out the first time. Then the second time.

It finally moved on its own.  BUT, now it ejects the film ribbon AND the label together.  The film is supposed to be winding itself back internally.  This is a defective product.  It seems to be common now.

Processed an Amazon refund!!  Do NOT buy this.  Try the 45013 instead.",1
"Within a month or two, they ripped.",1
I had the same problem as another reviewer. I packed a dozen moving boxes yesterday and this morning all the tape is lifting off. So I have to get more tape and re-tape them all. Poor product. Does not work as stated.,1
"Not sticky at all.  You can push it, rub it and anything else to keep it on the box, but it does not stay on the box.",1
Fell apart way too quickly.  The top is already coming off and had to replace.,1
After 6 months the thing is coming apart already. 2nd one I have had from them and it has done the same thing. I wouldn't waste your money on it.,1
"Takes me 10 mins to open up every roll. They had a silver thing telling you where to open each roll, but then the tape extends past that so you can't actually open it easily.  Have you geniuses ever tried to open your own roll of tape?  Switched to duck brand 245 and never looked back. 10 mins X's 6 rolls. I figure scotch owes me back 1 hour of life.",1
"Does not stay stuck down.  Have used it for years, have had this with at least 5 rolls.  Once what i have on hand is gone will find something else.

Update, I bought a lot of this in anticipation of moving.. it is roll after roll, it just does not stay stuck... I have been using this same tape for years with no problems, will never ever buy the moving and storage tape again....buyer really needs to beware.

It is past the time when I can return this, what happened to this tape, it will not stay stuck to cardboard which seems like a no brainer.",1
soft enough,1
"I have always been pleased with the Avery Greeting cards I've received from Amazon until this time. The cards smell as if in an old storage place and the seal on the envelopes are stuck already. I'm very displeased with this order. I needed the cards when I ordered them, or I would have sent them back. I noticed a date on the card box as 04/28/11, which is way passed when I ordered them, if that makes a difference?
K",1
These labels completely jam up my printer every time.  They are useless!!,1
"The greeting cards used to be fantastic. Now Avery has reduced the pound weight of the stock making it like cheap copy paper. Shame on you, Avery give us back the old card weight and charge a little more. I'm embarrassed to send the new lighter weight cards.",1
They don't stick....comeof very easily. Wonder how this can be packaging tape!,1
Paper too thick for printer,1
Does not stick well to shipping boxes. After a few minutes it was no longer sticking and just hanging there. Not happy with this stuff at all!,1
I purchased this at the 99 cents store hoping to hang up this cool Tron cutout I got its only 4 inches x 2 inches.  I placed tape on the back of it stuck it to wall and within an hour it was on ground.  Then I tried hanging up a picture.  Within two hours it is on the ground.  Pretty much this is good for maybe taping pictures into frames to keep them center or taping something just to hold it center while mounting other than that its useless.,1
"This product works well and was the perfect size for my desk.
The smell though, was unbearable. Seriously, it was disgusting.
I threw it away within 2 hours of taking it out of the package, as I couldn't handle the smell.",1
"1) The first 3 or 4 inches of this tape are NOT double-sided!

2) Therefore, you must pull out the first 3 or 4 inches of the tape (until the printed words on the tape are no longer appearing) and tear this part off the roll and DISCARD!

3) Touch both sides of the tape to make sure both sides feel sticky.

4) Use tape freely, there is no need to remove any protective liner, the tape will now be double sided each time you pull it from the roll.

The tape itself is decent, however the lack of instructions on how to initially use the tape and the confusing ""instructions"" written on the plastic part of the tape itself make this a very frustrating product.  It appears by the Scotch website that many people have complained about the lack of clear instructions and Scotch has known about this issue for at least four years. It is unclear if Scotch has done anything to remedy this very significant issue.",1
"It's super tiny, tears, and super cheap!",1
Useless. Totally inadequate. Might be OK for paper products but not much else.,1
We bought this for our move and we'd tape boxes; several hours later we'd come back and see the tape had come undone!  We'd retape it and it would do the same thing!  Needless to say it must have been old tape?  But when you are packing to move who has time for this!,1
"Cheap.  Thin.  Hard rather than cushioned.  Sharp uncomfortable edge.

I didn't pay much, and I didn't get much.

At $1.95, it isn't worth asking Amazon to take it back, although I am confident that they would.  I'll toss this one in the trash and spend a little more in the hope of getting something softer and with better cushioning.",1
This product is pathetic.  Any two sided tape I have ever used had a removable film on one side so you could press the tape into place.  This tape has no removable film so when you try to press it on it sticks to your fingers and pulls away.  Then the oils from your fingers make the places touched loose their stickiness.  Don't buy it!,1
"SMELLS AWFUL.  WORSE THAN A SKUNK.  So strong it will nauseate you. The smell sticks on your skin! UGH I have never purchased a mouse pad with this problem, what the heck?  Have it stuck out in a window for now and can't use it and some reviewers have said the smell does not fully go away.  Would not recommend this mouse pad and I normally LOVE Belkin products.",1
This last batch doesn't stick. All of my boxes have tape that have unattached from the sides since the tape is not sticking like it's supposed to. Time to switch brands.,1
to much money!,1
"I have been spinning my wheels for hours, trying to go through passwords, retrieve downloads, and be able to upload my designs.  It is not discernible on their website which templates are complementary and which ones will cost you money.  It is deceptive to buy this product because there are hidden costs for the designs before you can print on the designated business cards.  It has a download that goes to something that is hard to retrieve.  It says it will save on Adobe Acrobat, but it is still not accessible. You also must be adept at disabling your Pop-up Blocker.  I know many consumers know how to do this, but there has to be a more user-friendly means of making and printing business cards.

You may have better luck, but the Avery Website won't let me retrieve my old account or make a brand new one.  Frustrating.",1
"For it to be ""permanent"" I found that the regular Scotch double sided tape sticks much better. I specifically wanted permanent because I assumed it would be a stronger hold than the regular double sided tape. Never assume.",1
"Could not set these up for Word 2010, sent back",1
"This does not hold up and the seam where the gel hold up came apart. Looks like I have ""boogers"" at my desk...",1
"I was very disappointed in how thin these business cards are.  It is just like using regular photo paper.  I would not recommend using these if you are wanting to print professional business cards, sorry.",1
"Total waste of money. Doesn't stick at all. Initially sticks to your fingers a little, and as soon as you tape it to something, it falls off. Totally useless product.",1
What a waste of money! Do not buy because these don't stick and they fall off a day later. Not worth your money!,1
"The copyholder is big, flexible, and heavy as desired but Fellowes failed to engineer this properly so that all the knobs would stay attached to the product.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to adjust this copyholder the parts fall off of the copy holder and I have to hunt them down.  I'm either going to have to return it or superglue all the knobs in to place which would make it non-flexible. This is a terrible design and I can't see ever buying a Fellowes product again.",1
"Product had a little piece of paper on it that said ""damaged.""  The clear part that holds the tape was cracked pretty badly.  Like half of it was cracked.  It was then put inside the box and shipped to me.  I did not know it was possible to mess this up.",1
"Try as I might, it will NOT stay put on cardboard boxes. It constantly come loose and I have to retape it with Heavy Duty Packaging Tape.",1
"Big struggle to get it together with very insufficient instructions,  And then, it didn't work properly.  Something wrong with the arm joints. May be  that I'm not an engineer. It may work for someone else. Good luck!  Big chore to disassemble to return.",1
Too bulky.,1
"Like foil and everything else in the world -- if a company can make it thinner and still turn a profit, then they do it.  I will never order this again.  It's incredibly annoying when it folds on itself over and over when trying to box up things.",1

It had a HORRIBLE smell when I opened the package. The entire pad isn't made of the gel... It crinkles when you move your hands. Very disappointed.,1
"These are not clear at all. They are white frosted. I bought these to go on aqua blue envelopes, and it looks like I slapped a white frosted rectangle on there. I am incredibly disappointed and annoyed, but have no time to find a proper product to replace this garbage. The image I posted has an address on it, hence my finger over it.

First, though it was attractive and had a good weight to it, this mouse pad reeked awfully, and the odor of it was quite unpallatable for several weeks, but I persisted, thinking, oh this too shall pass.

Second, though, my mouse pretty consistently lost track of where it was.  My mouse can track itself on most anything, but it had a lot of trouble tracking on this surface. This problem was pretty consistent throughout the mousepad's tenure.

Overall, with both of these major cons persisting, after two months, I got the 3M Mousepad, and I couldn't be happier I did.",1
This tape is thin and doesn't hold anything and is so difficult to remove the liner that over half my role was wasted. I have onlu used it once successfully and that was to seal a small envelope with one Pc of paper in it. The rest of the time it was destroyed trying to get the liner off or I had to use the prove craft art accents tape with it because it would not hold. Scotch needs to discontinue this item and start over.,1
"They're not very sticky, and they come out curly from being rolled up in the Box for who-knows-how-long. They get curlier the further you get into the roll. So curly the first roll jammed about 2/3 of the way through ruining the ink strip. The next roll ran out of labels about a third of the way through. I'm already on my third roll. This is a very good label maker, but their labels suck big time.",1
Not clear nor easy to peel!  The labels are somewhat opaque and difficult to remove.,1
long lasting????HAHA ...this is the worst packing tape I have ever used......2 weeks after taping a stack of box's and the tape is lifting up and now I have to buy new tape and redo all the box's...will NOT buy again,1
"I tried this product and liked it, but tried to call Avery to gather more information on their products and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs to Manilla, Philippines!!! On their web site, Avery give the appearance that they are located in Brea, California, but in reality all of their consumer inquires, information on their products, software support, and general questions are all routed to the Philippines. I was not able to connect with anyone in the USA after more than 30 minutes on the phone with several different people in Manilla.

In addition, all of their products are manufactured in either Mexico or China. I am hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with any their products.

**************************************************
My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the ""Consumer Service Center"" in Manilla:

I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 to help me make the labels. It took some time to download and install, but well worth the time. The wizard was easy to use. Once you down load the software there will be a new toolbar in Microsoft Word. You simply click the Avery button and it gives you a comprehensive list of all of the Avery products (listed by product number). After that is takes you through a few easy-to-understand wizard windows to enter the text and layouts your labels. Once completed, you have a MS-Word document that you can save on your computer and reprint if needed. I was able to make address labels with a small graphic quite quickly and easily.

Even though these are listed for use on a Laser printer, I used them on my ink-jet printer and they turned out quite well. Even after roughing up the label by crunching it up, it stayed clear and legible. The ""Easy Peel"" backing allows you to reposition or remove the label although it does hold in place and will not easy fall off.",1
This does not stick well enough. I'm returning them. Back to Home Depot I guess.,1
Hard and too thin for use with an older keyboard.,1
"I had been used to using a Brother label maker at work and thought this would be just as good. Wrong. This tape will print fine, but when it comes to peeling it off of anything it leaves behind half the label and ruins whatever it was on. I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone. I'll be giving my Dymo label maker away.",1
"I have purchased this tape at various times over the years and have not liked it.  When I needed to purchase more packing tape, I bought a dispenser and decided to try the Scotch brand again.  I have to say, I still don't like it.  It just doesn't stick as well as other packing tape (specifically, I like the packing tape sold by the Post Office, but it doesn't come in rolls; only dispensers).  But I was feeling lazy and didn't want to deal with crowds at the Post Office, so now, I'm stuck with four rolls of this tape and will have to use it.  But I will definitely be trying another brand when this tape is gone (or maybe before if I get irritated enough).

Update:  I downgraded this from two stars to one star.  I packed a box with dishes about three weeks ago and reinforced (or so I thought) the box seams with this tape.  When I went to move the box, the tape had just ""released"" from the sides of the box.  Do not buy this tape.",1
"Used on 4 different packages and  85% of the tape did not stay stuck.  Had to go buy new tape that sticks.  I've never had tape, especially by Scotch do this. Sending it back",1
This product is terrible - I am moving and wanted to use this to seal the boxes before I pack them - after a few days the tope started to come off the boxes so now I have to go out and purchase locally better tape for moving and sealing the boxes - This product should not be sold for the purpose of  using for moving and sealing the boxes,1
"These are trans*lucent*, not transparent. If you're putting them on anything clear, they'll stick out as noticeably just as if they were white paper.",1
"... I though: ""How can you screw-up a mouse pad?"" Well, Belkin found a way with this mouse pad. Was using it just over a week when (at the lower edge where the wrist hovers) the red fabric began to roll of the black foam base. Whatever adhesive is being used to hold the mouse surface, in my case, isn't holding and I've a light mouse touch -- when I do use it.

I bought three to use with a bank of iMacs I have. If you look closely at a brand new pad right out of the package, you'll notice that where the die cut the mouse pad out of the manufacturing blanket the red micro fabric is finely frayed and clearly invites the fabric in time to dis-adhere from the (rather nice) foam base.

Shoot, just use the black foam back as the mouse pad. It's a beautiful red top -- but it will begin to roll off the foam.

Belkin and the seller should call this a ""DISPOSABLE MOUSE PAD"" because the beautiful red micro fabric top will wear and roll off in no time. Dang!

Advice: Spend a dollar more and I suspect you'll (I) will find more longer lasting mouse pad.",1
I personally do not find it very comfortable.  There is some kind of bag inside this that is annoying!,1
"Made out of cheap rubber material although it does work. However pad smells horrible unlike the decent $5 mouse pads. If you can stand the smell, go for it",1
"I received this wrist pad on 4-16. It smelled so bad (eye watering), that I placed it in the garage to air out. The next morning the two car garage was filled with a powerful, almost toxic smell.  I aired it outdoors on the patio. When I brought it in and placed it next to the keyboard, it smelled so bad, my eyes watered. Now, I'm not an expert, but if a product makes your eyes burn and water, the out-gassing must be toxic. I gave it six or so more days of airing out, and it still smelled. (It's made in China, so who knows what the plastic or gel is?)

I've arranged through Amazon to return it and get a refund.

It is a shame, because it is the most comfortable keyboard wrist pad I've ever had, but I can't tolerate burned eyes or possibly getting toxic poisoning from the product.",1
"the mouse side of these pads if hard and sharp, it cuts your wrist when you use it.
go with the standard version, its much softer.",1
Labels don't stay stuck!,1
Mine doesn't print anything which is immensely disappointing. Flawed product,1
Poor!!!,1
Jams up in labeler.,1
"I spent forever figuring out which type of Dymo machine I had and which refill tape would fit it, then choosing one to buy.  It doesn't work.  The 13 year old machine (seldom but cheerfully used) is still functional, but this replacement tape doesn't function correctly.  :(",1
Will naturally break the product,1
"Possibly the worst tape (or is it the box) I've ever used for moving boxes.  Of course, the boxers from U-Haul aren't what they used to be either.  This tape sticks to just about everything EXCEPT the box.  We just moved about 500 miles and it just didn't stick.",1
"Nowhere on Amazon's product page does it say ""Print only on one side"" (the coated side). That's what I learned when I opened the pack. Big disappointment! I bought this EXPENSIVE heavy weight paper for a printed catalog of my watercolor paintings.",1
"The description of this item says EPSON MATTE Photo Paper and what you receive is Epson GLOSSY Photo Parer.  I expected to receive Matte and I got Glossy.  Looking back at the picture of the item, it does say Glossy in the picture, BUT I went by the Item's description as I had searched for Matte paper and this item was listed  as being Matte in the Item Title in Bold letters.",1
"Belkin usually have good products. This is not one of them. It slides all over & using my optical mouse is hit & miss. My bare keyboard tray works much, much better.
I wrapped a paper towel around it & that improved it a lot.",1
"junk this mouse pad is the worse yet the cloth separates from the foam I have maybe a 6""x 6"" square left ... remember the old adage you get what you pay for and Belkin seems to be getting cheaper and cheaper in it's quality ...",1
"Must have been some factory reject product. Despite the brand name, this tape did NOT stick to brand new, dry, dust-free boxes.  We were in too much of a time crunch to return these.  Fortunately the movers brought lots of extra tape to secure this sub-standard Scotch item.",1
"Light, flimsy, slides around.  Not a high quality item.  I was  disappointed.  I like the heavy rubber-like mouse pads that don't slide around.",1
"Light, flimsy, slides around.  Not a high quality item.  I was  disappointed.  I like the heavy rubber-like mouse pads that don't slide around.",1
"Light, flimsy, slides around.  Not a high quality item.  I was  disappointed.  I like the heavy rubber-like mouse pads that don't slide around.",1
"The blue covering started peeling off within a month.  I have had others that wouldn't start peeling for six or eight months, this really surprised me.",1
I'm sure it's great but it's not what I ordered and doesn't fit in my label maker.,1
The fabric covering the top started coming loose at the lower left corner of the base exposing the gel after a couple of weeks of normal use. I wonder how many pennies Belkin saved farming out subpar manufacturing.,1
Horrible tape.  Worst I ever bought.  It splits every time I try to use it and it is a heck of a job peeling back to align the tape and start to cut another length of tape after wading up.  I will never buy it again.  I was trying to save money because I was tired of paying so much for the good stuff. . . but I guess we get what we pay for.,1
The first day it was great and I felt a difference. However within a matter of 2-3 more days the layers started coming apart. So now you can see the sticky white layer and the inner gel layer. It's really not made to withstand someone who needs to use the computer more than 30 minutes a day.,1
You get what you pay for. All I can say is JUNK. This paper is no better than middle class bond paper. Presentation? please this stuff is no where near presentation. Used every mat profile I could fins for this on my Canon Pro-100 and not one good result.,1
This wrist rest is too firm.  I kept it but should have returned it.,1
"Should I be complaining about something that was less than a dollar?

Yes, absolutely.

The top layer of material, the red layer, is coming off from both the top and bottom of the muse pad after about a week's worth of normal use. The adhesive or bonding process isn't holding the two layers together.

The size of the mouse pad is very good.

It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.

Waste of time with this mouse pad. Surprised at the lack of quality from Belkin.",1
"Look, it is a mouse pad.  It really doesn't even ""work"" - it just is, except when it comes apart.  Two days, that's all I got. Bad Dog.",1
"Oddly enough i found this product on amazon while searching for something to replace it. I suppose i should warn people.

This at best holds thin books. Anything that has any recoil (books that close themselves), and its uselss. im not talking spring loaded, just plain paper back books.

The good:
Adjustable, collapsable.

The bad:
rarely holds pages secure.
easy to break.

definitely not worth 11$. think i got mine for 5 at office depot.",1
My Bad - I bought the wrong item,1
"This is undoubtedly the poorest excuse for tape that I have ever bought from Amazon. It sticks good but is so thin it will tear when trying to remove it from anything. I've used Scotch brand for years, but will never buy this junk stuff again, must have been made in China where so much other junk comes from. From now on I will look at the thickness of the product before I buy. I use a lot of packing tape & have always used Scotch. I just assumed this was a quality product but I was wrong!!",1
Horrible. Terrible. Cheap and you will find it listed OVER and OVER again on Amazon under keyboard drawers. Dont waste your money. Cheap junk.,1
"I bought two of these. At first glance they appeared to be identical to a name brand pad I bought at a local office products store for a much higher price. They aren't the same though. I should have paid attention to all the one star reviews.

These pads have a gritty surface, like fine sandpaper. The mouse does not move smoothly over this surface. It skips a bit. Also, it is annoying to the touch. Plus it makes an annoying sandpaper like sound to boot. I couldn't even drown it out with my mp3 player and earbuds. Now that I took time to read all the one star reviews I see that they will fall apart in no time as well.

Tossed both of them in the trash. What a waste.

The more expensive one I bought locally has a silky smooth top and is heavier duty. Lesson learned.",1
Cheap flimsy garbage. Try something else. You'll thank me later,1
"They could have added 4 screws to make sturdier but saved $0.10 instead. Genius. The whole thing feels cheap. Disposable. Poor instructions. Design should have been so you can't put parts on backwards,  but that takes extra thought in design.",1
Package was opened.  Paper subjected to water and sticks together.  Will not feed correctly.  Quality is bad.  Will avoid this dealer in  the future,1
"I guess I was expecting something that wouldn't buckle with ink.  Very disappointed.  As a cover sheet with no printing, sure, it's fine, but for printing on, forget it.",1
My old mouse pad lasted three years and this one didn't make it three weeks.  Oh well live and learn don't bother with this one i'm afraid.,1
"Very disappointed in this order.  Amazon's sale page for this item clearly states that this is ""photo"" paper.  I have Matte Photo Paper in other sizes and it has a coating on the paper to absorb the ink and reduce the glare.  This is just PLAIN PAPER in the large size.  The photo of the item on the sale page is not a photo of what you get and the title of what you get clearly states that this is Presentation Paper NOT Photo Paper.  ""Presentation"" refers to the large size, not the nature or quality of the paper.

What a waste of my money and extra shipping costs to overnight this product.  I want a refund!!!",1
"This EPSON Photo Quality paper is legal sized, 8"" x 14"", coated one-side, 27 lb., ink-jet paper stock.
It is thin photo stock - only printable on one ""coated"" side, then follow directions for extreme
care of the prints . . .  For a fellow looking for quick production, sturdy photos, this stuff will never do.
It is very flimsy photo paper.",1
Cant install the product because holes on the brackets didn't line up with holes in the sliders,1
"First let me start by saying that I love the feel of this wrist pad. The problem is simply that within two months of average use, it has two separate seems that are opening up.

It really is too bad because I like the product outside of it's durability.",1
"No starting tabs make it a gross pain to open a roll. I could not figure SCOTCH to have missed such an important feature. 3M Office Products should be punished for that ""mistake""----and their price is no bargain at all. Rip-off !!",1
Both cartridges defective and would not work My new printer works great with other cartridges we purchased at the same time. These were on clearance but selling defective stock as clearance is not nice! Worse the cost of return postage wipes out a refund so into the trash they go,1
Didn't use them.  Bought them with what I thought was a label printer on cyber Monday special.  Turns out it was just a bulk feed tray for a label printer.  Returned the whole batch for a refund.,1
Item was short 3 screws and the holes were misaligned for bolts and nuts.  Returned.,1
"Multiple ribbons have broken and DYMO was slow to respond to support requests.  When I asked if they would replace the broken ribbons, they were not very responsive and requested so much information about the broken ribbons it wasn't worth my time to deal with them.",1
"They aren't the exact same size as the originals and don't work in a Smart Label Printer. The originals have three holes between labels and these only have two which means they don't feed properly. My recommendation is that you don't purchase these labels; unfortunately, I bought two boxes which I had to throw away.",1
"The installation instructions that come with the Kensington Smart Fit K60004US keyboard tray are terrible.  Few words, unnecessarily tiny illustrations, AND ONE BIG ERROR that can ruin your purchase.

The package comes with 3 different types of screws - labeled D, E and F on the instruction sheet.  The illustration for Step #1 shows screw type D but you should USE TYPE E (its the smallest screw provided).  If you try to force type D into the underside of the keyboard as shown, this larger screw will enlarge the grommet (hole) and make it impossible to use the correct, smaller screw later.

If you make this mistake, you can either return the item (and who could blame you since the item since the manufacturer provided such lousy instructions), or you can make a trip to the hardware store to buy a wider shank version of screw type E which will grip the sides of the now enlarged grommet (which I did).

On a separate note, the sparse instructions also do not provide any indication of where to mount the brackets underneath your desk - even a cheapo keyboard tray usually includes a template for this purpose, but I guess the graphics folks at Kensington were too preoccupied screwing up the instruction sheet.  I recommend mounting the front edge of the front bracket somewhere around 3.0"" in from the desk edge (but not less than 2.5"" or the tray will stick out when closed).

By the way, the ""SmartFit"" feature of this product simply means the bracket mount is height adjustable from 1.5"" to 3.0"" but you will find most other models are too, so big deal.  The package includes a cardboard cutout tool to help you measure the distance between your knees and the tray.  No kidding - I hope I didn't pay extra for that.  And the instructions on how to use that tool are so incredibly indecipherable I'm still not sure what the company was trying to tell me.  Kensington really should fire whoever came up with this stuff.

All of this advice will all make sense when you install the keyboard, so you might want to print this review now to have it handy when your order arrives.  Is it a good keyboard otherwise?  I'll write a follow up later.  I just suffered thru the installation today and haven't formed an opinion yet, but I sure hope Kensington does better with design than it does with instructions.  I did notice the mouse pad does not adhere to the tray so it slides around along with the mouse - I guess that's a bad omen.

Lastly, the tray is BLACK, not white like its pic.  Amazon notes this correctly under ""Product Specs"" in the listing.",1
This is the worse packing tape I have used.  I have to tape the box at least three times and then it does not always stick.  I have used the individual rolls of scotch in the red holders and it is great.  I will never buy this one again.,1
AVERY ONLINE TEMPLATES DO NOT SEEM TO WORK WELL WITH MY CANON PRINTER,1
"For starter the DYMO machine that produces the labels is junk.  Had mine for 1 1/2 month, and just tossed it in the trash (stopped working).
These labels are crap.  The black ink tape come out along with the label, so you have to peel off the black ink strip the the label backing.  Messy.  2 out of the 3 label cart's didn't even work.  Get a better product, or just accept the bad assness of a sharpie marker.",1
"only .5"" high not 1""
fabric is not durable, wears through and hard to keep clean

other than obvious lack of function due to height, no leaks, does not stiffen up over time

Innovera is a better brand",1
This is too thin to provide wrist support while using a standard pc keyboard.  My wrists began hurting within minutes.  In order to get any use whatsoever from it I have to place it on top of the old bead filled wrist rest it was meant to replace.  This wrist rest would need to be almost twice as thick to provide support.,1
Wasn't as good as the heavy duty tape,1
This looks nice in red and is large. However after a couple of months it is peeling apart. Would not recommend this product.,1
"Product was poorly constructed at the seams. Within about a year the seams opened and the gel like material started to flow out. On the positive side it is comfortable. however, given poor build quality, cannot recommend.",1
The tape is to light duty and the adhesive is not aggressive enough,1
"A Mouse pad is a mouse pad, I don't think any manufacturer can get it wrong. But this one smells horrible - Buyers beware it smells of chemicals I don't understand what they are. Since it is dirt cheap I am just going to throw it away, but hopefully other buyers read my review and look elsewhere.

Where is Belkin quality control on this?",1
"We had two, both came apart within two months.  Comfortable while they lasted, but surely wouldn't be buying again.",1
This label tape drove me mad. It arrived stuck and I almost broke my label maker.,1
The wrist pad I brought a couple of months ago had a terrible smell when I purchased it and the smell is still there but not as strong. Now the gel is coming out at the seams.  I cannot use the wrist rest and I tried to fix it but it cannot be fixed.  I would not recommend this item.,1
"Something has really changed from the first time I bought this!! I believe it is counterfeit tape. DO NOT BUY.

The new tape actually breaks just pulling on it slightly tight - not just once, but repeatedly!! It doesn't tear - it just breaks all across the tape at once. I've never experienced anything like this on any tape. I bought this tape a couple of months ago because I knew I would be running out soon. And last week, I finally ran out and started using the new tape.  And to my amazement, the new tape broke repeatedly. I have an direct comparison because I was still using the old tape when I ran out and started using the new tape. Now I suppose I'm past the return date or I would return it. I will never buy this again! It is almost useless. And to make matters worse, it isn't even sticky - just falls off the box on its own.  It won't even stick to a new cardboard box more than an hour. Better to buy unbranded tape than this garbage. Can't even believe this is Scotch brand.
--------------------------------

Prior review: I finally used up my first set of four spools of tape.  The tape has fairly good adhesive, although I think it should be sticker than it is. On very smooth surfaced cardboard boxes, it simply doesn't stick very well. It has even become unstuck on its own a few times even after pressing it on hard. I use the backside of my fingernails in a forward rubbing motion to force it into the smooth box surface better and that usually keeps it from falling off. But I don't trust it long term - will probably fall off.",1
Didn't work,1
Very cumbersome product. There has to be a better product out there. Their software is incompatible with wireless HP Office Jet pro 8500a. Instead of printing it tries to send it as a fax. I tossed them.,1
Horrible product. Didn't work at all,1
I also purchased these labels as well as another brand of labels for my online sticker business when I was trying to print from a laser printer.  I have the exact same problem as was mentioned beforebwith the  toner rubbing off. I did switch printers back to an ink jet. The laser printer folks told me that these were the only labels that could print on my printer  so I tried it before switching back to in the jet printer so imagine my disappointment when I found the same problem.,1
Did not work in my HP printer. Followed instructions and the picture turned out a smeared mess.,1
"Avery 5305 Tent Cards are terrible. The line to distinguish where to separate the cards is indistinguishable from the embossing lines. The cards are not designed to print both sides of the table tent as only one side is embossed with a 'frame' to hold the content, which also significantly cuts down on the printing area.

The template they provide online only allows you to design one face of the tent card. If you want to print both sides, you have to design your own template, and carefully align it to the nonexistent cut lines. Even after all that i ended up ripping about 6 sheets before I gave up and tossed the whole thing in the trash.

I cannot give this product my recommendation.",1
"I had an old roll of this tape, pre 'long lasting', and it worked fine. It did eventually age and became hard to peel off or lost its stickiness. But that was after being in our very hot attic for 3+ years. It's expected.

I go to buy more, of the same, but now its 'long lasting'. Yeah, I immediately was suspicious. I've now used 4 rolls of this to move and the tape has peeled off most of what I put it on. The tape itself lasts, but NOT the adhesive. Funny enough, the tape that peeled off is still sitcky, but it won't stay. Which makes this tape pointless. Like other reviews, the tape began to peel off shortly after placing it. Since I only needed it to stick until we were done with our move, I didn't care, plus I'd already used 2 rolls, and had 2 more...  I also tried to use this to send a box, it sticks initially, like before, but isn't a firm stick. So, I really wouldn't suggest sending a big box or a package that isn't square if you used this tape. As for it getting to its destination, well, lately I've gotten quite a few boxes with tape that's come unstuck leaving the box open in places.  The tape is still sitcky but its not firmly stuck to the package.  I'm almost certain they used the same tape.",1
I bought these to make my own stickers to use in my planner. I was first disappointed by how thick the sticker paper is but desired to give it a try anyway. I designed my stickers and printed them out on the sticker paper using my laser printer which I was told would work with these. At first glance I was pleased but as soon as I sat down to cut the stickers out with my exacto knife the simple movement of the paper caused the ink to rub off on places. It was the worst where the slits in the backing where because the sticker paper kept naturally creasing there and creating white lines in the printed images. I've tried printing a few more times and the ink just won't absorb into the sticker paper like it does with regular printer paper. I don't know if it's because I should use an ink jet instead of a laser printer or what but I'm sadly disappointed in this sticker paper and will be looking for a replacement.,1
"This tape does not work very well compared to the same Brother label tape. It is harder to remove the backing and does not stick as well. If you need to do any labeling, I would highly recommend the Brother brand instead.",1
I had a hard time finding a template to work with these.,1
These do not stick well to regular envelopes. The corners peel off easily and result in import documents getting returned or lost in the mail. I can't believe these address labels get such good reviews. I wish I had read the other one star reviews before I purchased.,1
I labeled a bunch of boxes in the garage and every single label has peeled off. Ended up wasting my time and money.,1
"It appears that Scotch has redesigned their winning packing tape and totally ruined it. Have been using their tape for years and it has been outstanding. Bought a new roll today to send a boxed package across country and spent over an hour trying to get it taped up enough to hold together. This NEW stuff will only stick to itself; it absolutely will NOT stick to a cardboard box. Finally, after using a half roll of this stuff on a 15""X12""X12"" package by wrapping it around and around, I HOPEFULLY got enough wrapped around it to be able to get it shipped. Will know tomorrow when I take it to UPS and see if they even accept it.

If you get a roll of this that advertises ""20 Times stronger"", be aware that it has changed drastically, and NOT for the better. The tape may be stronger but the adhesive is practically non-existent when it comes to holding a package together, unless you totally encapsulate it in tape.",1
"I'm disappointed that many of the labels had adhesive melted on the wrong side making them too dangerous to harm the printer to run through, which would damage your printer drum. I attempted to find a way to just get some replaced, and I took photos of the damaged paper, but there is nothing to do except a ""return/exchange"" option which I don't really have time for a few sheets of paper. That seems expensive and wasteful. I just want the labels replace as they are VERY EXPENSIVE about $1 per sheet when you factor in shipping.",1
After purchasing them I received a different off brand label with a sticker on the box that stated it was Avery..,1
"This is the worst packing tape ever made.

Bought a multi-roll package at my local BJs club, and I was totally disappointed to see that there was no stickiness on this tape whatsoever.

I mean, anything you seal comes right off.

If you want packaging tape that really does what it is supposed to, go with the DUCK brand.  It's my favorite.",1
The black printing media began coming out of the cartridge making the cartridge unusable.,1
Didn't work,1
"I'd thought these would be the typical 23' cartridges, but at only 10' the price is pretty steep. I did like the neon bright label color, but not at a 50%+ premium.

The price-per-inch should have warranted a 3-star review normally, but these suffer from the same problem as many of the other Dymo label cartridges I've bought recently, the tape sticks in the cartridge and you have to pull out a bunch to get it to feed properly, so after finally getting the stupid thing to work I've pulled out a good 6 to 8 inches of this expensive tape. This is completely unacceptable!

Dymo really needs to get on the ball and fix the problem with the tape feeding or I'll be switching back to my old Brother label maker.",1
"It worked a couple times,it won't work,very disappointed,Becky",1
This paper was totally useless for my purpose. It is a flat matt finish and does not produce good pictures in my opinion. The product arrived on time and in good condition.,1
"This was the exact same as Cover Stock paper (cover stock is thicker than card stock)

Was hoping for a finish that was more professional looking and paid triple the price for this paper. Cover stock is identical and can get 3-4 times the amount for the price.",1
"this was shipped with one other item in a box that was too big and had little packing to keep it from moving around. Because of this one corner of the paper was bent. Of course you can't tell if the paper is hurt unless you open the box and when you do you can't ship this back.
I can get this paper for $2 more at Office Depot so you can be sure I will do that in the future. I will also rethink anything I buy from Amazon on how it may be hurt when shipped.
Poor shipping !!",1
"This is absolutely ridiculous!

This ultra premium photo paper is just of unacceptable quality. In the photos, on the right is Epson photo paper, on the left is Officedepot photo paper( which is nothing fancy, average quality stuff.) they are printed from the same image and same printer, with same setting: photo printing, Matte paper, quality set as High.. You can see the dramatic difference. The color is completely off on Epson paper, also, in the next two photos, you can see that the ink is running, smudged and fuzzy. So....how am I suppose to use this paper for anything?",1

I begged him for a little patience and understanding.  After a little back and forth I eventually told him to just leave that I'd figure it out myself.  He left and took all of the instructions with him when he closed out the chat.  What a jerk.

I will NEVER do business with Avery again!!!!!!",1

"I used it on my Epson Photo 960 using the ""Glossy Photo Paper"" option as the paper type (this could have had something to do with it).  The photos were very wrinkled up due to the thinness of the paper.  Better to go with Premium Glossy paper or Premium Semi-gloss.  Theres a big difference.",1
"Received printer had visible damage to box,printer didn,t show damage, hooked it up and it would not pair up with our program to print contracts",1
BEWARE the product that's sold is different from the picture.  The labels I received do not have TrueBlock Technology and they very flimsy.  They also not stick well.  This appears to be an old version of these labels or their counterfeit.  I've been buying these labels for over a year and they always came the same way until I place a recent order. The original labels are thick and stick very well.,1
"I put it under my optical mouse, so my cursor wuldn't ""jump"", but this thing has almost NO friction on my desk.

I'd rather have to deal with an occasionally ""hyper"" optical mouse than a mousepad that won't stay still.",1
"UPDATE: After using this item daily for under 3-month I can tell you that it's not even worth the price of the add-on. The cloth has already begun to separate from the rubber mat on two edges If it lasts another month I will be lucky, in the meantime I will be looking for a new mouse pad!

Not really tacky enough to hold in place, keeps slipping as I move the mouse. I may wind up with double sided tape to lock it in place.

This thing is terrible don't buy it it's so bad,1
"You get what you pay for. As a mousepad this thing feels cheap and it slides on top of your desk fairly easily. It is however a good pad to set something fragile on. My co-worker has a big photography camera and needed a pad to keep the camera from scratching the glass desk or vice-versa, so I gave him this and it works perfect. It is a good pad, but not a good mouse pad.",1
Fabric separated from the rubber pad along the edge where my hand rests when using the mouse - after only one week! I had actually ordered a second one with my next order and the same thing happened.,1
Good at first but cloth cover started coming off after a couple weeks.,1
"Edited: One week, no more than 20 hours of use, and it's trashed. Don't buy this one.",1
"This mouse pad has too much texture.  This causes a scruffing sound with every move of the mouse.  And, the mouse doesn't perform as it should on this pad.",1
seriously its low price for a reason the sides are already worn out only been useing it for a week and its not even more than an hour a day look for a better mouse pad,1
"Light, flimsy, slides around.  Not a high quality item.  I was  disappointed.  I like the heavy rubber-like mouse pads that don't slide around.",1
Bought this to replace my old mouse pad as it was getting dingy and worn after years of use. Now I'm still using my old pad.  This one is stiff and has very rough fabric. It's so lightweight that it will not stay in place. Absolutely worthless.,1
"poor design that does not work as wall phone.  Handset does not ""catch"" onto base when vertical which leaves the line constantly open.  No one can call in.",1
This cheap phone will not stand on its own. It is made very cheaply. More importantly it did not work. You get what you pay for.,1
"I brought this phone becasue I needed something becasue I work from home.  It sits on my desk and does not move.  It worked fine the few times that I used it.  Today I was trying to use the ringer button and it did not work.  The phone also had a lot of static. I had a dial pad that I also use for work and the connections was fine, so process of elimination it was the phone.  Now I have to look for and buy another phone but will not purchase this again. Hence the saying, you get what you paid for.",1
returned,1
"I did not realize until now that it doesn't have one feature on it.  I received a call from my Dr. confirming an appt.  They asked for me to press 1 if I would be able to make the appt., I pressed, and kept getting a message they could not understand and started all over again.  This has happened on 3 important medical calls and I NEED this option.",1
inexpensive... too cheap. was expectiing quality that these phones used to be.,1
"UPDATE:  I return my original phone and got a new one.  SAME issue.  This phone's handset just would not latch properly onto the cradle so the phone never hangs up!  So, if you plan to wall-mount the phone, fine something else!
============================
I bought this to replace my wall-mounted phone which had served me well for the past 10 years.  This phone's handset does not latch properly onto the cradle so the phone never hangs up.  As such, it appears ""busy"" and thus no one can call me!  I am returning this defective product.",1
Arrived dead.,1
"The price of this phone perfectly reflects its quality, which is to say that it really feels like a $10 phone. If you're expecting one of those Sherman tank-built Trimlines that the phone company used to install back in the days of land lines, you will be sorely disappointed. Would I buy it again?
Waaaat? Are you nuts?",1
"The buttons are silly.  Why would I want the letters the same size as the numbers if I'm punching in numbers?  Six rows of buttons to push; too much of a choice!  Things should be more simple.  I want numbers, in logical places.  Difficult phone.  Want to toss it out and get another one, but am waiting to find one I want.",1
I did not like this phone. i plugged it in and it made a loud screeching noise then quit. I thought it was the phone jack but i tried another and nothing no dial tone or noise. I called my phone company they told me to plug it directly into the internet modem and still no dial tone so I returned it for a refund.,1
"Had AT and T come out three times to fix our phone line. Finally ordered another phone. Turns out it was the PHONE that was defective not our line. Choose another phone, this one is useless.",1
"Does not work, right out of the box.  Completely inaudible.  The ""volume control"" had no effect, the dial tone was as indistinct as the sound of faraway bees on a lazy summer day.  Cheaply made, poor quality materials.

This is another example in the crapification parade engineered by our Harvard-style MBA's to ""maximize shareholder value"", a.k.a. loot formerly robust companies, by hollowing them out and selling the mere shell of their ""brand"" to overseas bidders.

Now I'll simply go to our local 99c store and buy a ""Trisonic"" Shenzhen original.  Or maybe bid on eBay for a 1970s true Bell / Western Electric Trimline-- those will work forever.

PS the vendor itself is fine, fulfillment by Amazon painless as always.",1
"I couldn't get any of the additional features to work, then the thing just died... waste of money.  Luckily it wasn't too expensive.  I tried calling AT&T but they weren't helpful.",1
Broke after a year.,1
this phone is crap.  It lasted one day.  Amazon sucks for charging so much for this crap.,1
"Super tinny sound, and people on the other side of the call think I am calling from inside a cave.  And it stopped working all together after a few months.",1
"Full of mold. And don't work, lose connection, wires fall out. Please. I've had these phones for awhile. They are awful, and going into the garbage.",1
"This is the first time I've given a product such an awful review. Would have had NO stars if possible. The cord that connected the jack in the wall to the phone base didn't fit the plugs on the phone. And then the cord between the receiver and the handset also didn't have plugs that fit the phone. Seriously?!?!  Amazon was kind enough to just credit our account. Didn't even ask for it to be returned, as they likely realized the product was hugely inferior. Appreciated that much.",1
Returning this - this is NOT a wall phone as it came up when I searched.  Looks like it should be but will not stay in the cradle. Cats had fun smacking it around the kitchen while I tried it.,1
Hand to return. Phone was defective. No dial tone,1
Sent this item back !!!,1
Died in less than a week had to return it,1
don't have this,1
Rang once and the ringer stopped working. Total crap.,1
"BUYER BEWARE, it lasted less than 6 months then the ringer stopped working.",1
Cord gets tangled,1
Poor imitation of a vintage trimline phone.  Too light.  Feels more like a toy.  Sent it back for a refund.,1
"Voice feedback from the receiver makes this phone unusable. You get what you pay for apparently, even with the AT&T nameplate. No repeat dial. This one was returned pronto.",1
"Poor quality and they only lasted about a year until the sending voice quality was terrible. No one could understand what we were saying. We had purchased two and they both had the same problem. We put them out in the garbage .. lesson learned from these ""rejects"". I think the one star rating is too high for that junk!",1

The working parts are more compact, because it uses integrated circuits, which are cheaper and more reliable. The AT&T 210 has many discrete components that can and often do fail.

Both are assembled in China, but assembling the Uniden involves fewer steps. Anyway, I've had two AT&T 210's fail on me. One had a defective mouthpiece that probably never worked properly. The other had a busted ringer. I bought one Uniden and it has worked perfectly--my phone nightmare is over.

The Uniden is also cheaper--another advantage of integrated circuits.",1
i was so happy to get a new phone. Works fine except for the programming. You can not program phone numbers so it auto dials. Bummer. Not worth sending back.,1
"does not work..would not recommend.  I had this type of phone years ago, wanted an extra phone in my bedroom but it has never worked.",1
"can't recommend this folks although it worked fine. It just looks bad in 2013, so unless you have this hidden away, get a modern phone. Mark in NY",1
The phone I ordered does not have an illuminated keypad as advertised. Therefore we have no use for it. It was ordered as an extra phone for a bedroom.,1
"So far, I'm not impressed.  The typewriter purchased for the use of this product malfunctioned the first day.  I've not sent anything back yet.  I'm hoping that I can troubleshoot and therefore keep the product for future use.",1
"Great classic design.  I imagine it is a wonderful phone if you get one that works.  Mine refused to ring, and yes I checked the ring setting.  Returned it.",1
"I bought this thinking, ""It's from AT&T, how can I go wrong?"" However everyone I talk to asks if I'm on a cell phone and if the reception is bad where I'm at.",1
"First off it's $12.99 so I should have known it was a cheapy to start. But you figure it's a corded phone ,so how old is that technology. It looked all-right out of the box but the lighted dial is very dim. I plugged it in and all was good. But eventually all the people I talked to told me I sounded like I was talking thru a pillow. I changed lines,no change,checked other phones in the house and this phone was bupkiss from the word go. Went out and got a Panasonic for $25 and everything is good to go.",1
"I'm very happy with the purchase of this product and the fast shipment.  The phone is lightweight, however was easy to install as a wall phone and has some memory features that I would not expect in a phone for the cost.  Happy with the price and performance!

After using this phone for over a year, my opinion of this phone has changed! 90% of the time, the phone does not ring.  Good for making calls, but awful for receiving calls.",1
"This phone is okay for a cheap phone, but on a wall mount, the receiver will NOT stay on the base, it just falls off.",1
"I wanted a basic telephone that was affordable and designed to be hassle-free (just easy to use).  I got exactly that, but I also got a phone whose keypad didn't work days later.  I returned it and got a similar, but better phone.

I needed a basic, corded (so when I dropped it, I could retrieve it) phone next to my hospital bed for emergency calls or just calls from loved ones who are concerned about me.  I am bedridden and I haven't walked for decades; A good performing, reliable phone was what I was looking for -- not what I got!

My physical issues are due to a neuro-muscular disease/disorder (supposedly supported by MDA) that is both debilitating and degenerative.  It involves the progressive loss of coordination and muscle strength leading to motor incapacitation.  In my experience, MDA is a JOKE!  I have learned that MDA attempts to make everyone believe that they are out to help people like me, but instead, exploit us for their own selfish monetary gain!  During my lifetime of 45 years, realistically, MDA hasn't done anything for my disease/disorder -- not even a simple treatment!  Thus, I need this particular item as a result of this continuation of my physical decline.",1
"Based on the reviews of some ppl saying this phone is cheaply constructed, I have to disagree. I found this phone to be heftier than I would have thought (solid durable plastic). What do you expect from a phone that costs about $10.00. You can't expect to get the old ATT trimline phones from 25 yrs ago that lasts a lifetime.

I bought this over a month ago and haven't had any problems. It's fine for the bedroom and for use as a back up if the power goes out and the cordless phones don't work. The numbers light up and you don't need to plug it in an AC outlet. It gets its power right from the wall outlet phone jack.

The volume control is a great feature for anyone that's hard of hearing. It can get pretty loud on the high volume setting.

For $10, buying this phone was a no-brainer. The only drawback I found was that the cord from the phone to the base was a little short. I had a longer cord laying around from an old phone and just used that.

UPDATED 5-21-11. Phone is now DEFECTIVE!!! The depress button by the ear speaker jammed and wouldn't release. The phone would not let me answer or get a dial tone. It was just STUCK there. When I tried to release it by pressing it on and off with my fingers, it broke. DON't BUY THIS PHONE!!!",1
"This phone started to have problems around the 1yr mark. First, a lot of static and now it just keeps disconnecting calls. Looking for another.",1
Don't buy this phone.  Not all the keys light and when one talks there is an echo in the earpiece that is almost painful.  Probably the phone is defective.  Back it goes.,1
"So far, I'm not impressed.  The typewriter purchased for the use of this product malfunctioned the first day.  I've not sent anything back yet.  I'm hoping that I can troubleshoot and therefore keep the product for future use.",1
"It was defective and Amazon refused to replace it, even after admitting fault.",1
The ink is not dark enough even thou it says it black.,1
"I use to love these pens, but I've had so many go out on me or the ink is moving around, never again.",1
"I purchased these pens based on rave Amazon reviews. I can't get them to write at all unless I exert tremendous pressure on them, IF  I am lucky. I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and it it too painful for me to apply this kind of pressure on a pen.which should not be necessary.

I can't believe that these are the same pens that so many have rated so highly. I'd return them if they had not been so inexpensive.
They are going  in the garbage.  I can't believe these are made by Bic.",1
Not the original white barrel,1
"Update:
These pens are terrible.  I honestly never thought I could give a low priced box of 60 pens a bad review.  I mean, it's 60 pens for $4.00, how can you go wrong?  These pens suck.  I literally can't give them away anymore and it's a running joke to try and give one to someone when they ask me for a pen.  The quality is horrendous.  They will randomly stop writing on you minutes, sometimes even seconds, into using them for the very first time.  Certain surfaces that most other pens can write on?  Forget about it, these ones won't even attempt to let go of their ink.  I....hate....these....pens.

Original:
Its pens.  60 pens.  They work.  They have ink, the cap comes off, goes back on, you can throw them even.",1
Not what I thought I ordered(Round Stic Grip with stripes logo beneath cap) and I thought I had deleted this huge box from my order but probably my mistake.,1
"They don't last long. After a few uses, they ran out of ink.",1
"I usually stay away from Bic due to bad experiences with them in the past (ink not coming out, leaking). But since these were ""more life"" pens, I gave it another try. They are still awful. I found that 4 out of 5 pens have very light ink, like it's not coming out. They start out writing ok but after a couple of lines, the ink starts thinning out. On the photo, all the writing was done with the same pen, but you can see how some parts are dark and some parts light. Especially on the top right corner, you can see the writing is barely coming out even as I pushed down hard (which after awhile of writing made my hand sore). The 5th pen I thought was ok until I looked on my finger and saw a splotch of ink. Then I looked down my arm and saw splotches of ink all over. And they won't wash off.

Sorry Bic, I'm going back to Pilot.",1
"These pen leaks like crazy, I work in the nursing field and need to carry a pen at all times, i have so meany ink stains in my smocks.",1
"Often does not write after just sitting, unused for awhile.",1
"These pens are hard to write with.  They get stuck on the paper as you write, making cursive writing tedious.  I do not recommend them.  I ended up finding reviews about Zebra pens, and love those!",1
"These do not work well, cheaply made. I am bummed I have a lot of them. I ended up throwing out",1
Really inexpensive pens that tend to skip and run out quicky. Even as just extra pens I would get something else. Not recommended.,1
"Cheap cheap. Do not buy worthless.  I will buy my next pack of pens from. CVS
The ink is dried up even with the cap on.",1
"OK, Here it is.  I'm a guy. I put the pen in my chest pocket.  I that position(Upside down)  The ink runs away from the point- rendering there pen  non -functional.  I have had at least a half dozen shirts ruined, because traditionally the ink would next run out of the hole on the side of the pen.  These are very cheap, very low quality pens;  might be marginally adequate for people who don't have or use chest pockets.",1
"So. May. Pens. Lol! This will definitely last us a long time. I love the way they write, and I'm pretty sure its safe to say it will last me both semesters if not longer.",1
I found that these pens did not write well. I would not recommend them even for a filler item as often I find air bubbles in the ink and have to scribble several times while I am writing.  These went in the trash.,1
"Although the pens write well, there is a slippery silicone that keeps coming out of the plastic and gets on your hands... and it can not be washed off. Touching these pens is horrible. I know the chinese use the silicone as a mold release and more and more of the plastic items these days have this problem. It makes the pens unusable. Don't waste your money.",1
"The package contained 10 pens. The front label says ""Writes first time, every time!"" I tried all 10 pens and only 2 would write.",1
"This is my third time at writing this review and Amazon keeps kicking me out!!!
Just saying I hate this tape arrrghhhh
will be buying the green label matte finish from now on
complete waste of moneh",1
"Clarification.... MY mistake!
I did not read the description to understand I was purchasing ONE 70 page spiral notebook which, in August, I could get for a quarter at Staples or Target.
I saw the photo of six notebooks, saw the phrases ""assorted colors"" and ""one subject"", saw the $2.00 add-on price and I thought I was getting six notebooks in assorted colors.
Not a product I'd normally read reviews for.
As I said, my mistake...no deal here.",1
"I feel it is misleading to show six note books. Normally when one buys one product that comes in varying colors there are color charts to show the colors. I thought for the high price of almost $3.50 I was getting six notebooks. At my local supermarket there is always a ten cent sale for notebooks of lesser quality so the price seemed reasonable to me. I was very upset to have paid $7 for two notebooks! I contacted the seller about returning them, but didn't hear back. To add insult to injury when I now look, the price is 47 cents.  I know prices fluctuate, but really.  I feel ripped off.  Unless one really, really can't get to a supermarket one should not bother to buy this product.",1
Did not work in my HP printer. Followed instructions and the picture turned out a smeared mess.,1
"this was shipped with one other item in a box that was too big and had little packing to keep it from moving around. Because of this one corner of the paper was bent. Of course you can't tell if the paper is hurt unless you open the box and when you do you can't ship this back.
I can get this paper for $2 more at Office Depot so you can be sure I will do that in the future. I will also rethink anything I buy from Amazon on how it may be hurt when shipped.
Poor shipping !!",1
"Not happy with toner.  Had to send it back. It printed very grey, light, ghostly and is suppose to be brand new.  As advised from the seller, we shook the cartridge, checked our roller, did a printer configuration and it still was very light.  We even put our old toner that was near empty in it and the old one worked excellent and was 50 times darker than this one.  Tried to save money but was not worth it.  Don't bother.",1
"I read all of the negative reviews before deciding to purchase this, so I can't say I didn't know the risks. But the price is so good that I couldn't resist (I guess that's how these things keep selling). What I received certainly looked like an authentic HP toner cartridge -- the box was intact, the cartridge seemed new, the pull-string (which gets the ink flowing) was still attached. So I was optimistic.

Well, as soon as I printed a test page I could see what the problem was -- the ink was very, very light, as if the toner was diluted (or the ink was dried out). I tried shaking it, but no luck. Everything I tried to print came out faded and almost illegible.

The good news is, Amazon's return policy is first rate -- I had no trouble printing a return label, packing up the faulty cartridge, and dropping it off at UPS. I haven't yet received my refund (the package needs to be received by Amazon first), but I expect things to go smoothly. If I have problems, I'll update this review.

Bottom line, from the reviews it's obvious that ordering one of these cartridges through Amazon is risky -- some customers claim the cartridge they received worked perfectly, while a lot of others had experiences like I did. The low price makes it worth the risk as long as returns are honored.

UPDATE 8-29-2014:  Amazon credited my account without problem -- in fact, the credit was amazingly fast (and no charge for return shipping, since the product was defective).

One more thing -- I just purchased the cartridge from my local Office Depot (paid a bunch more for it, of course), and I notice that there is a holographic sticker on the box, covering the zip tab to open it.  There was no such sticker on the box I got from Amazon.  This is a clue that the cartridge I received was either a knock-off or out of date.",1
It Prints Grey not Black.... I'll return it and try again. Amazon customer service will back it up.  It LOOKS like HP packaging but the quality is poor.  Maybe just a bad cartridge.,1
"Although advertised as ""new"" and ""original"" and were bought directly from Amazon, both cartridges I received were past their expiration date. Additionally, one of the cartridge boxes itself was damaged even though the Amazon shipping box itself was not.

This is first time I had this experience with Amazon.  From another customer comment dated October 2009, Amazon appears not to care about disclosing this on in its web site advertisement.",1
"I rarely give bad reviews, please check out my others for verification. This one is different because HP has scrimped on quality to save a buck and ruined a great product. I've owned: 2, HP 19BII; 1, 12b; 2, 10b; 1 10bII. The new 10bII has damaged my opinion of HP substantially. I have also owned 2 Texas Instruments BAII Plus. (The CFA Institute has made changes over time). I'm much more comfortable with HP than TI, but the HP 10bII is a faint shadow of the 10b and is of VERY low build quality. My ""5"" key requires significant pressure to register. In fact, the 10bII is a flimsy piece of junk.",1
"Like the other models of HP, the 35s and 300s, this one too suffers from missed keystrokes.

I like the look of this calculator, and if you are slow, and deliberate with your keystroke entry, you can get results.  However, when you first turn it on and start to press the keys with any speed the calculator seems to hic-cup and does not record your entries.

The HP 35s exhibits this behavior also.  The last great non-graphing scientific calculator produced by HP was the HP 32sII.  HP has gone downhill in calculator manufacturing.  Too Bad.",1
"I had this for maybe 3 years, hardly used it, never abused it, and one of the LCD digits burned out.",1
"Typical Chinese clumsiness and low quality. The on off button is too easily bumped to on, and the little sack they call a case is so tight it activates the on button.

Even without the ""case"", I cannot carry it in my pocket or briefcase without turning it on and depleting the batteries, so it sits in or on my desk.

I leave it out, and no one will even steal it.

Both of the two I have had were intermittent. The first one had the display die, but it was replaced under warranty. Wish they had given me a TI BA II+ instead. Wish I had bought one instead.

The third one just had the display fail. All the characters are not complete.

I like the calculator when it feels like working, but it is unreliable.

After it had a permanent display failure, I nailed it to the wall of my office with a very long nail so it can be seen by anyone walking by. I am amazed by how many of my co workers have stopped and told me they had theirs fail, as well.

What a tragedy that a fine company (like HP used to be) is now peddling such junk. I go back to HP with RPN, and always loved their quality and durability. No more.",1
"These did not work in my printer.  My HP is real picky about the paper it will process and it definitely did not like this brand.  Be careful when ordering papers, make sure your printer will work with them.",1
It wasn't what I was expecting and I am returning it today.,1
"I bought this to replace my Palm TX, which will not work on Windows 8.1. I can not synchronize that Palm with my desktop using Windows 8.1. I do not seem to be able to use the PalmOne m500 by itself or synchronize it with my computer, so it is gathering dust in a drawer.",1
I like the Palm Pilot but I am locked out & need a contact number or instruction manual to enter my password again. I returned the Palm Pilot to Mr. Sporn Israel with the promise that he would replace it with a new one if I mailed the one I couldn't get to work. Now I am having a problem getting him to live up to that promise. I ordered a different from another company & would like a refund for the Palm 500 that I sent back to him.,1
"The supplier of this products tells me that this is an old ad above.  That it no longer comes with a hotsync cradle and you can't use it with 64 bit Vista.  That none of the Palm products will work with 64 Vista if you have to use the connection cord so I had to send mine back although the supplier said he would credit my account thro Amazon, I am still out the postal fees both ways.",1
"I owned a terrific Palm V which I dropped and destroyed by accident. Then I bought an m500. What a mistake. It has been nothing but problems.

I had the same problems as everybody else with the USB cradle not Hotsynching. I tried resetting the handheld several times and eventually it came back on. But what a royal pain. Also, the battery has been a problem too. For two weeks I couldn't get a charge to hold. Again, hard resetting it over an over helped.

This device cost far too much to behave this way. Tech support was limited and not helpful. I won't buy another Palm device.",1
"Looking for some 'cheap' electronic organizers, I came across this one.  The floor model was on sale, so it made it a great deal.  The software was not included and I wasn't told that I needed software to make it work with my computer.  The sales associate made it sound as the Palm would install the needed components on my computer.  No where on the box did it mention a CD-ROM to install.
With this lack of software, this thing is pretty much useless.",1
"I own this thing for a year. After first 3 mo of usage it stopped hotsynching. Well, my Palm had a warranty, so I received a new ""refurbished"" unit. It worked for about 10 months, then I had this problem again. Had to change USB to a different cradle. It worked for a month, and then my PDA died all together. It will not start no matter what! Needless to say, I lost all the data, and as a small business owner, it was a major problem for me. STAY AWAY FROM THIS THING!",1
"I've had this phone for a couple of years now. I bought it for a home office hoping to get a two-line properly duplexing speaker phone that wouldn't have my coworkers and customers complaining about the sound quality I was getting with the Unicom that it replaced. It has met this requirement - most of the time. But there are times that it really misses the mark and you can't carry on a conversation with the speaker on.

The microphone has good pickup of my voice but is terrible at masking out background noise. The caller on the other end will hear everything in the room like they are sitting at your lap. There is insufficient gain control to even mute the sound of cars driving down the street with the window down.

The speaker sound quality is great but way too loud. Even on the lowest volume setting, it's much louder than my speaking voice. I usually end up putting something over the speaker to mute it to a tolerable level.

Using it with the handset is not good. The cord is too short and stiff. Sitting a reasonable distance from the phone pulls the base off the desk. I know you can purchase a longer, more resilient cord but at this price point you have the right to complain about the cheap, barely adequate one Polycom ships with the unit.

Like other reviewers here, I've found the LCD display to be at the wrong angle and it's not adjustable. You have to stand up and look down at it to read the display. The menu for reviewing Caller ID information is terrible. I'd like to know if the call came into my home line or business line but it's impossible. The phone directory for storing frequently called numbers is too hard to use.

I've all but given up using the speaker phone feature and bought a Plantronics wireless headset to use with it. The headset is fantastic. But with the phone cradle design on the Polycom Pro it's impossible to get a good fit for the handset lifter. It works, but you'll find yourself having to manually hang up the phone about 20% of the time.

My real problem with this phone is that the labels on every button I use have worn completely off. And I don't do a lot of calling with it as most calls are received.  The paint is very cheap and started coming off in the first couple of months. All but a few seldom used buttons are all anonymously black now.

This phone is way over priced for the quality Polycom put into it.",1
"I am now on my 4th Polycom Soundpoint Pro phone since April 2008.  If it wasn't for the 1 year warranty, I would have trashed this system a long time ago.  It must be geared for the home user and not for business applications as I am on the telephone 75% of each day with customers and vendors.  I have been very disappointed in the telephones sound quality, performance and features.  When you attempt to connect two callers via the conferencing feature, the parties cannot hear each other.  There is no backlight for the display which makes it difficult to see and I would expect with the price paid for this phone, Polycom could come up with some sort of LED.  When you attempt to use the speaker phone, it is reported as being very poor sound quality and I am frequently asked to pick up the headset.  It also has a limited range for increasing the volume for the call.  The ultimate failures have occurred when the phone will not disconnect the calls.  It leaves the lines open.  Tried to trouble shoot but keep getting the same response from customer service that they have not experienced this problem before.  I have read on the internet in several places that this same problem has occurred with other users of this particular phone model. The telephone power supply is plugged in to a surge protector that inturn is plugged into a back up power system; so power surges can't be the problem.",1
"I would not spend the money for this phone.  I work at home so I decided to invest in a really good phone with 2 lines and a speaker.  The handset was always hot when I picked it up and put it to my ear.  I contacted the company and they did send me another one but it did the same thing.  So I decided to live with it because the speaker was good.  But with use of less than a year, the sound became lower.  No one can hear me on calls and I can't hear anyone else with the volume up.  I contacted the company but it had been over a year so no luck getting help since it was now out of warranty. They would fix it if I paid shipping and a repair job but it would be almost the cost of a new phone.  I did my own problem determination by swapping the phone with another one and the new one was fine, I also replaced any parts I could like a different hand set that fit, a different phone line cord, etc. So, I have a $200 paperweight.  Do not waste your money.",1
stopped working correctly after 1 day. would not clear memory.,1
"This product has malfunctions, in less then one month the keys stop working and it does not add. I just tried to return or exchange it, I was told that the return policy had expired. Nearly a $70 calculator and it's broke already, Makes no sense to me. I used it for my home office, and I probably added on it tops 3 times. What a Joke",1
"Probably the worst printing calculator I've ever owned; and, there have been many.  Unit is beset with both ribbon and paper-feed problems.  Print capability completely went down shortly after the product warranty expired.  Now useful only for visual display--something one could obtain from a smart phone.  Use some judgment, if you're considering purchasing this.",1
"I know, It is Scotch tape and I bought it on passing with such a low price.  It fine BUT

THE ROLL IS TINY - about half the size of what I have come to expect from a normal roll of Scotch Tape that appears in the picture.

All my fault.  Didn't know they made child size versions, and didn't even check before buying.

And it's still scotch tape, just much narrower and a lot less on the roll.",1
"It's broken after rarely using alarm for 4 months, just totally dead.",1
thin,1
"Mine came without the packaging with no numbers, brand, or anything.  I think it came from a multi pack. This product is a joke. You can not possibly imagine how tiny it is. Do not buy this!",1
"I was disappointed with the size of the tape. It is too narrow. I should have measured the previous one that I had, then I would have seen that it was 3/4 inch. This is fine if you are putting the tape on vertical, but if putting it on horizontal, the wider tape would be easier to use. I would send this back if I could.",1
"It's one roll of 450 inches! I should have read the fine print. I just assumed that anything on Amazon is a great bargain.
Until I found a package of three of the same rolls for less than I paid for this one.
 Next time I'll go straight to the drug store !",1
Very poor quality!,1
The paper is extremely thin. Sometimes the lines don't even show up. It is a rarity to have lines on the back side of the paper. Would not recommend.,1
"Poor quality compared to their regular paper.  I only bought this one because it was for 200 pages; and, the other package was only for 150 pages.  This was is made out of a terrible quality as a ""recycled"" paper.  I'd rather buy the regular paper.  Who cares about a lousy extra 50 pages?  Not me.",1
"tried to use it on some DIY cards, but the glue didn't really stick.  Maybe I'm forgetting how poorly glue sticks worked when I was younger.",1
I purchased this product for my printer and after installing it didn't work ink was dried up. I don't recommend this product.,1
This cartridge worked great. I had to order it because an Amazon seller sent me the wrong set and I couldn't get Amazon or the merchant to correct the order. This is the only example of me feeling ripped off by Amazon and I sure wish they would correct the matter.,1
"this was a defective unit, from the get go. When you removed the tab to use, it was attached to the eclectronic connnection on the bottom which ripped it and made the cartridge useless. Do not buy this from this vendor. I had to wait and then had to repay for a new on from a different vendor. U get what u pay for.",1
"One of Amazons sellers sent me the wrong set of cartridges. I ordered this one and a number 16 black cartridge but was sent a set of 28 and 29s by that merchant. I couldn't get them to respond to emails and needed cartridges so I had to reorder.
Dont misread this review, the proper cartridge work just fine, I just got screwed by a merchant that Amazon is supposed to stand by and they didn't and neither did Amazon. So, I finally got this, part of the correct set of cartridges but still have a useless to me set of cartridges that Amazon nor the merchant that sold them will do anything about. Amazon is not flawless and they proved so well to me.",1
"purchased the base unit (which includes one handset) and two additional handsets. They worked okay for about a month or so, then the handset started inexplicably dying. Sometimes the screen went totally blank and you would lose the call or couldn't dial. Othertimes the screen said that I was too far away from the base (even when I was literally right next to the base). So I called customer service and they said that it sounded like I needed a new battery (after a MONTH!). I actually read the directions before using the phone and I wasn't even putting the phones on the bases to recharge after every call so that the NI CD batteries wouldn't develop a memory (they don't use the better Lithium Ion batteries that do not develop a memory). So this made no sense. Anyway, I went ahead and bought the batteries (for all three handsets) and that didn't solve the problem at all. I then went ahead and purchased another handset. Again, no problems for a month and then the same issue. Customer service issued remanufactured phones (4 handsets) and in about a month to 8 weeks all were exactly the same.

I know I wasn't doing anything wrong to cause this. I began searching the Internet and low and behold I am not alone. Apparently a law firm in New Jersey has already filed a class action law suit against Panasonic for the entire KX-TG and KX-TC cordless phone lines. Search ""panasonic cordless phone class action"" on google. It will be the first hit. As an attorney myself (not in any way affiliated with or even previously aware of the firm that has filed the suit), I can tell you it takes a lot of consumer complaints before a law firm decides to invest its resources in a class action suit as they are very expensive and time consuming.

So, I've learned my lesson the hard way (although there wasn't anything I could've done differently at the time of purchase). Hopefully, my experience and research into this can prevent you from having to deal with it in the future. Panasonic was unjustly enriched in distributing such a defective product and not having the corporate decency to at least recall it and replace it with a functioning line or refunding our hard earned dollars. Very disappointing and I certainly will not be purchasing the Panasonic brand again.",1
"Mine worked pretty well for about the first 50 labels that I made.  Then the font size got stuck ridiculously small so that the message only covers about 10 percent of the tape surface.  If you want really small labels with a hard-to-read font size, you could use my PT-1750 to print them out and then cut down with scissors to eliminate all of the wasted label area.",1
"The TI calculators are heavily dated tech - they are not worth the cost. If your school is requiring you to purchase it - boycott the purchase and use your laptop / phone / tablet. Stop letting companies like Texas Instruments have a monopoly over the education market, especially when there's free open source alternatives.",1
"The item shipped from Amazon did not match the photograph of the item ordered. I believe the shipped item is possibly an updated version of the item photographed. My problem with the item I received is that the keyboard layout is completely different. I ordered per the photo because I was looking for that specific key configuration. The item received has one less column of keys and one row more at the top for misc functions. My biggest complaint, and the reason I returned it, is that the Clear All and Clear Entry keys are in one key on the shipped item. I selected this calculator because there were separate Clear All and Clear Entry keys. I'm not sure why all new calculators have combined these keys. It's as if they never thought to ask an accountant when they changed the design of these things. Beyond frustrating.

If any sellers actually have the item pictured, please separate your listing from this one and identify it as the item actually pictured. Or if you comment on my review and leave contact info, I will receive a copy. I know four accountants that are prepared to buy this item if it is actually available.",1
"I have a lot of Canon products, and I've been generally very happy with them, so I figured a Canon calculator would be a safe bet.  So very very wrong.  First, the keys require an excessively heavy pressure to work.  My fingertips are sore every time I use this thing.  What's frustrating is that if you hit the + key anywhere off center, it tends to stick in the down position.  Then when you key the next number and hit +, the previous number gets added again and the button finally pops up.  The calculator is also very loud, compared to others of it's type and price.  The display is bright and easy to read, as long as your number isn't over 1,000.  The comma for the thousands digit is, inexplicably, above the number, not below, although the period for the hundreds is on the bottom.  At a normal distance, the last printed number is so low down inside the calculator, I can't see it without craning my neck.

All in all a truly horrible calculator, with the sticking + key it doesn't even fulfill the minimum requirement for a calculator: adding up columns of numbers reliably.  After writing this review, I'm going to buy a new calculator tomorrow and throw this six month old mistake in the trash.",1
"This printer works only with outdated operating systems (Windows XP or earlier) and WILL NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7.  Therefore, I cannot install it to work with my computer--AND THEN I LEARNED THAT IT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN TO THE SELLER.

I was pretty angry, so I wrote a review critical of the printer -- and Amazon.

But I contacted Amazon, and they made it possible for me to return the printer.

So YEAH! for Amazon -- and RASPBERRIES for this printer (and Acedepot).",1
Almost useless. Could not get it to work with IR. No drivers for system. No tech support. It is almost worthless. It arrived used and was supposed to be new. Could not return. Hope to get it to work with something.,1
outdated said it would work. It didnt,1
"The cartridges had expired in 2008 and 2009, which I could not tell until I opened the inner wrapping, and needless to say they did not work. I threw them all out and replaced the printer with one for which cartridges are still made. Waste of money.",1
outdated said it would work. It didnt,1
"I am retrning this scanner to the store for a refund.
The main reason is that some snapshots when scanned show a purple shading not present in the original photo. Not every picture, mostly  pictures taken in the shade. This is unacceptable. I  emailed  Tech Support about this purple tinge problem but they, so far, have failed to respond.
I had read about this purple issue in some reviews, but not all. My guess is that the users who did not report this problem had not scanned an image that would generate the purple tinge....yet.
Other negatives are that the scanner connector cord is very short. It limits scanner placement options. I can't place the scaner on the shelf I used with my old scanner. It requires a special connector so no ordinary USB cable will do.
The scanner is noisy, but not objectionably so.
The scanner is always on and draws power from the PC through the USB connector. I like to turn equipment on when I want to use it.
But the overriding concern is the purple tinge. So I will read reviews about other scanners a lot more carefully now.
However, if an occasional purple tinge to your picture is not objectionable to you (maybe purple is your favorite color), then this is a good scanner at a great Amazon price.",1
"I had to throw this printer out.  It was simply too unreliable.
The first unit I had streaked.  After three exchanges of the printer, they finally sent me a new drum.
This printed for about 4 months, and the streaks re-appeared.

caution  before buying.",1
"This would be a real deal -- if only it was compatible with Windows XP, which it is not. Before you buy it, use a good search engine to find user comments, and you'll discover that (1) Brother is still negotiating with Microsoft over XP drivers, and (2) Brother's support is non-existent. Even their website is useless.
Not good.",1
"This paper constantly makes my printer jam! Its too thin! My printer doesnt jam when i change the paper, it only does it with this type.",1
"I purchased this paper for everyday use because it was available on Amazon Prime. Now, I know why it was on Prime - inferior quality and high mark up. This Epson paper is more of the $4.99 quality not $8.99. Print on this paper is more gray than black and letters are ""fuzzy"" and not crisp. This is evident on both Everyday and Normal settings on my HP Inkjet printer. One could NOT use this paper for anything formal or important. Faxing anything printed on this paper results in very poor fax quality for the receivers. I compared it to two other everyday papers I use and it was the worst of all by far. HP Multipurpose paper (20 lb.) is much better by far AND less expensive. IMB Ultimate Inkjet paper (24 lb.) is top-of-the-line for everyday use but its availability is limited. The Epson paper was the least ""white"" compared to the other papers referenced above and the packaging has no Brightness rating on the box. Like noted by other reviewers Amazon packaging was poor resulting in the paper covering being torn and the corners of the paper being bent and creased. This was evident on BOTH packages of paper that I purchased. If you need paper a trip to the store for a different brand of paper is much better than Amazon Prime free delivery. You will pay double the price and get poor quality with this Epson paper!",1
"I liked the calculator size, ease of use, etc. Then I read the fine print that says not to attempt to change the battery yourself. You have to pay to send it or bring it to a Canon dealer to do it for you. I think the original price is plenty to pay for this calculator without having to pay extra every time you need to change a battery. I am requesting a refund. Buyers beware. Nowhere did I read on Amazon's description about having this extra headache. I want a calculator to reduce my headaches, not add to them. I don't want to have to worry about how long it will take to get the battery changed and therefore be without a calculator. It shouldn't be that hard to change a battery on a simple calculator. Just another way to make money for themselves. No thanks.",1

I tried everything: reinstalled the driver, put paper in both paper paths, new toner, printed from different applications, unplugged USB cable and power cord and NOTHING!  Amazon said it is too late for them to do anything so I contacted Samsung and I am waiting, not so patiently, to hear from them.  Be warned.",1

"Bought this after looking for a good sized hand/desk calculator and liking Sharp products in general.

"The worst pens you'll ever buy!
If you want an erasable pen that barely writes and cuts out as if it's running out of ink, then it's perfect for you!
Wasted our money on these in all three colors (blue, black, red) and they all write the same.  Spend the extra money on the Frixion brand. You'll be much happier!",1
"The seller is great, product arrived on time, but the writing quality of the pens is a fault of the manufacturer. The pen skips a lot and the writing looks horrible, sometimes it will not write at all on certain spots on paper. The ink erases fabulously but the writing is so poor it is money wasted. If it really needs to be erased either use a pencil or a white out strip.",1
"These pens hardly write. I have to go back over my writing multiple times just to fill in the letters. I just got them yesterday and it seems like there is no ink in them. Yes, they erase but good luck getting them to write. I'll be switching back to frixion pens.",1
"It's unfortunate that Paper Mate are no longer making the kind of erasable pens they made twenty years ago. A short while after these arrived, the pens began losing color - by that I mean, writing poorly, with the blue becoming so faint I might as well not be writing at all. They're cheaply made, they don't erase well, and I really regret having wasted my money on these.",1
"this pen writes decent, but as for erasing, don't bother trying, a total waste of time and money.",1
"I bought these locally mistaking them for Stick Erasers.  They are awful!  To write the pen must be held nearly upright or it scrapes and I can't write even one word without the ink clogging. The eraser does work on this ink only, not even on pencil.",1
"They don't erase! The writing part is okay - and I was fine with ""okay"" ink for the price. But when I went to erase, it just...didn't. It faded a bit, but it definitely didn't erase. There's no way to neatly write over what has been ""erased."" Waste of money if you want truly erasable pens.",1
"Sux no ink.. All dried out had to throw out,",1

"I am a puzzler, crosswords, sudoku, etc.; since I was a preteen.  This pen has been my pen of choice for as long as I knew they were around. I am a senior, so that means, a loooong time!! This last batch is disgusting!!! I was so upset, I called and emailed the company! They told me to send them in and I could get my money back. You know at that point, I cussed!!! I didn't want my money back, I wanted a decent pen that works for me. We puzzlers are very particular about our puzzles; we want the paper and puzzles to stay nice and clean!! That is why I preferred pen over pencil, but, THESE PENS SKIP AND THE ERASER SMEARS!!!! I am afraid to purchase any more, because they are horrible. They truly messed up an excellent product trying to save a little money, no doubt. I might give them one more chance to get it right, maybe!!",1
"They're fine as red pens, but the erasers don't erase. Instead they smear the red ink around without hardly picking any up, leaving an ugly red blotch. In the case of a newspaper crossword puzzle, it leaves an ugly red (pen ink) and black (news print ink) blotch.

The previous generation of Erasermate pens wrote just as well as these but they erased pretty good, so I sadly bought 5 of these things that are useless for crossword puzzles.

The four pens will go to our local thrift store, and I hope whoever buys them doesn't pay more then a dime each.",1
"I have used these pens for years.  But, last time I purchased the pens it made for a terrible experience.  Watch out for the black pens with the white erasers.  The white erasers smeared the ink all over place.  I had a cap left from an older pen (with a black eraser) and used that instead.  The black eraser still worked well and did its job, but I'm shying away from buying new ones.  I guess I'll purchase a different brand.",1
"I love erasable pens and was hoping that this would be a cheaper alternative to the more expensive Frixion erasable pen.

Nope. The ink is barely readable. Nor does it erase very well; it just smudges. The Frixions are a lot more expensive and they run out pretty fast but they are far superior.

Sorry Papermate. But you shouldn't be selling garbage such as this.",1
"These pens are terrible. I bought a bunch of erasable pens from various brands at the same time and surprisingly, these pens Paper Mate pens are the worst of the worst. Oddly, the coloured version of these pens works far better than these black pens. The ink barely comes out, the erasers don't work and I've thrown them all away.",1
"Cartridge produced horizontal dark streaks every 1.25 inches or so-- 7 per page-- with center of page also dark. These dark areas had diffused borders. All-in-all, similar experience to several other reviews. The toner cartridge appeared completely new, sealed in bag, completely labeled HP, but in an older style HP box. Perhaps this box sat around in temperature conditions outside that recommended by HP (box says -20C to 40C). I bought it for $67, which, though much more than many remanufactured cartridges, is less than brand new HP ones. HP's site currently shows the 15x at $99 and the 15a for $89.",1

"Got this a couple weeks ago, direct from Amazon: HP brand new, supposed to expire Dec 2015.  First time printed just fine.  Next time printed about a week later, the yellow ink had dried a bit, so had to run the utility program to clean the cartridge; only had to do so once and everything printed okey dokey.  A week later, similar situation... but the red ink would not print totally after two ""cleans"" -- there was a row that just stayed white.

And on the third clean the printer died...  Guess somebody's trying to tell me something.  Anyway, maybe a dozen pages printed and the red ink jet clogged forever.

Hope Amazon takes this POS back, tossed the box when I first tried it out...  The printer (bought in Oct '99) has been great, up to now... the cartridges not even close.

Followup - Decided to forgo ever using an inkjet again, I don't print color often enough any more to get any good use out of them...  duplex color laser from now on.  (Sadly, my first one has some color issues (greenish blues) that I didn't detect until it was too late to return it - next time I'll get it right.)",1

"I read the reviews, thought I'd take a shot.  Built-in WIFI was the seller for me.
Got the unit, and despite some of the reviewer's luck in using the wireless, I found it to be flawless.  Worked beautifully, good range and good strength compared to my notebook computer.
Battery was the problem, though.  It started out like the ""good"" reviews - lasted a while (2 hours only used 25% of it w/o wireless), and with the wireless going, I could surf, remotely control my servers, or do email and messaging for over 2 hours and still have battery time left over.
Then suddenly it would go from full charge to 1% and give me warnings about imminent data loss.  I contacted Toshiba Tech support, who made me jump through some hoops I had already jumped through on my own, and they offered to replace the battery.  But they're backordered - 2-4 weeks *minimum* wait.  The battery issue is a *known* issue and isn't a guaranteed fix.  There *is* no guaranteed fix for this known issue...  So rather than wait to see if the battery fixed the problem, I'm returning the unit before it's too late.
Unit was great, but as long as Toshiba is pushing things out the door that they know are defective, it's going to be tough for them to compete.",1

"I have installed both 82 and 82 in my printer. The cartridges worked for a while,and have about 7/8 capacity remaining. I use the printer most every day,so it isn't a matter of dried up ink. The printer doesn't print the blue color,so the color cartridge is not working properly. I have cleaned the printer heads-----ink,and without good results.",1
"It's hard to find this ink cartridge, so I'm grateful for it's prompt availability from Amazon....",1
I had to print several times (over 10) to get the color cartrdige to work properly.,1
"We puchased this unit for use in several small stores owned by the same company.  8 total phones/base stations were purchased, all new (not refurbished).

Of these original 8 phones, 4 of them had the battery go south within a few weeks.  The remaining 4 phones lasted a month before their batteries also went south.  By going south, I mean that you can charge the battery for as long as you like and it will die after a few minutes.  For a retail business, this is very bad.

To fix the problem, we have tried to replace the battery from Panasonic, but it is not even offered on their website, nor is the phone itself.

If the guaranteed battery failure isn't enough to deter you from this product, let me give you some other fun treats with this phone:

1. It drops calls.  Not just calls for the battery dying, but calls will just randomly drop.  You know it is bad when you have to tell customers to call back if the call drops.

2. The error tone is deafening, as it sounds in your ear.  It actually hurts when the low battery tone goes off or another problem causes it to chirp.  Ouch.

3. When you are on the phone and the call waiting tone sounds, it shuts the sound off on your conversation for a second or two.  Very annoying to need to repeat yourself or ask somebody else to repeat what they said every time another call comes in. (Basically, the phone shuts down for a second or two if you have another call and will continue to shut down each time the call waiting tone chirps during that conversation).

5. The range of the phone is laughable.  The 900 MHz we had before this had at least double or triple the range and never dropped calls.  Maybe I am being greedy in wanting a phone that has more than a 30-foot range, but it stinks when you decide to go 40-feet into the back room and your customer thinks you are hung up on them.

6. You cannot delete messages from a handset - you need to go to the base station to do that.  This wouldn't be a big deal if everything else hadn't already frustrated me about this phone.

7. Panasonic's customer service is not good.  Maybe it is the sheer volume of calls they must have received for this product, maybe we just called on three different days that were bad days for the reps, but they will not help you with this product for any reason.  We were told it was discontinued when we called the first time (2 weeks after we purchased it new)  It was being sold to electronics stores even when it was discontinued and not supported by Panasonic!

Bottom line: BUY ANY OTHER PHONE BEFORE PURCHASING THIS NIGHTMARE.

We spent over $1000 total for all our phones & base stations (supply lady's decision, not mine!) and have had problems from the start.  I have been unimpressed with Panasonic's products and customer service and would caution you to do more research and stay far away from this second-rate product.

My wife and I have already avoided Panasonic products for our home because of the experience I have had at work with this Panasonic product.

Cheers, etc.",1
"I purchased the base unit (which includes one handset) and two additional handsets. They worked okay for about a month or so, then the handset started inexplicably dying. Sometimes the screen went totally blank and you would lose the call or couldn't dial. Othertimes the screen said that I was too far away from the base (even when I was literally right next to the base). So I called customer service and they said that it sounded like I needed a new battery (after a MONTH!). I actually read the directions before using the phone and I wasn't even putting the phones on the bases to recharge after every call so that the NI CD batteries wouldn't develop a memory (they don't use the better Lithium Ion batteries that do not develop a memory). So this made no sense. Anyway, I went ahead and bought the batteries (for all three handsets) and that didn't solve the problem at all. I then went ahead and purchased another handset. Again, no problems for a month and then the same issue. Customer service issued remanufactured phones (4 handsets) and in about a month to 8 weeks all were exactly the same.

I know I wasn't doing anything wrong to cause this. I began searching the Internet and low and behold I am not alone. Apparently a law firm in New Jersey has already filed a class action law suit against Panasonic for the entire KX-TG and KX-TC cordless phone lines. Search ""panasonic cordless phone class action"" on google. It will be the first hit. As an attorney myself (not in any way affiliated with or even previously aware of the firm that has filed the suit), I can tell you it takes a lot of consumer complaints before a law firm decides to invest its resources in a class action suit as they are very expensive and time consuming.

So, I've learned my lesson the hard way (although there wasn't anything I could've done differently at the time of purchase). Hopefully, my experience and research into this can prevent you from having to deal with it in the future. Panasonic was unjustly enriched in distributing such a defective product and not having the corporate decency to at least recall it and replace it with a functioning line or refunding our hard earned dollars. Very disappointing and I certainly will not be purchasing the Panasonic brand again.",1
"Consumer ADVOCATE advisory- inventory on this product was manufactured around 2002 or 13 yrs. ago. No matter who you purchase it from, you will receive nos merchandise. I am evaluating it's effectiveness at stopping robocalls. I will update this rating in the near future. EXPECT YOUR ZAPPER TO BE DOA. The 2032 Lithium cell battery will be dead after 13 yrs. The battery is replaceable. You do not have to solder it, provided you receive the 2nd generation unit made in 2002. You can identify this by the basic or advance selector switch being mounted on the outside of the unit's case. You will need a very small eyeglass Phillips screwdriver to take the case part to reach the battery. Take a small slot edge screwdriver to carefully push the battery out of it's holder. I strongly suggest you buy a new Everready or Duracell retail packed battery. I don't have stock in these companies. Usually, especially Energizer has fresh stock. Expect to pay 3 bucks for the new battery. Factor the battery cost into the purchase price.",1
Returned it because it simply does not work.,1
"Item arrived with dead battery as others had pointed out. Package had a 2001 date in the instruction pamphlet. Believe me the package looks that old. Came complete with dead bug and battery. If you buy this item test the battery first. In order to remove battery without pulling circuit card out I used a tiny screw driver to push battery out of its holder.
I would expect a little better considering the price of this item.",1
"Doing a simple internet search will take you down the path to finding this product currently for $29.97.  Do not pay this seller twice it's value, especially since most of us don't have land lines anymore.  Anyone selling it for so much is trying to unload their inventory and get their money back.  Buyer beware and do your research.  That being said, any device that sends out the ""disconnected line"" tones will be effective against robocalls.  Other cheaper options are to download the sound of a fax machine onto your laptop and play that when you see a robocall come in.  Of course you'd only be successful at that method if you kept getting repeat robocalls from the same unknown area code.

If you really want to have fun with these ""poor souls just trying to eek out a living like anyone else"" just tie them up on the phone for a long time.  They get paid by the number of calls they handle and the number of scams they pull off.  So tie up their time and you can have a small passive-aggressive victory dance around the dinner table.  Don't yell or get angry at them.  They're already locked and loaded for those calls.  Plus it will just get your adrenaline going and make you angry.  Nothing good will come of that other than you being angry.  They're just going to call someone else and so on and so on.  Just pretend like you care about what they're saying and drag on their conversation for a long while.

Other options for meddling with them are blasting a loud whistle or horn in the phone (but some digital phones will cut out the loud noise.  So that doesn't always work.  I've also had success pretending to be a business when I see the caller ID and recognize the robocall area code (NYC in this case).  Once they realize it's a business they called the operator will usually take you off the list because a business isn't engageable in a personal currency scam.  In the end they'll always be harrassing you as long as you have a phone (like junk mail in your mailbox).  Even if your number is unlisted these machines will randomly dial numbers at digital speeds.  So don't think the machines can't get through.",1
"Hate it waste of time -- still get just as many annoying calls as before. Save you money. It is on my business line, but still get the same calls from live person and computer generated calls.",1
DON'T BUY THIS. IT DOES NOT WORK. MY PRINTER KEPT SAYING MISSING CARTRIDGE. I RETURED IT AND A GO ONE FROM A DIFFERENT VENDOR.,1
"This product did not last, stopped working the second day in the middle of printing a map I needed. It was new still in the box and wrapped and arrived in good condtion and this is not the fault of the vendor, possibly on the shelf too long maybe or a manufacturers defect. It lasted 2 and 1/2 pages and was dry.",1
"I am getting really frustrated that so many companies now offer a cheapie version of a product and then nicer more serviceable versions. The cheap version can be simple and no frills but it is ridiculous to make the cheap version useless.

This paper is so thin you can see the writing on the following page (not just the other side) through it. The gentlest of marks scars the paper as if you dug the pen in. The paper has no tooth at all. It is as slick as writing on wrapping paper. Not only is it not pleasant to write on, it doesn't facilitate good penmanship. The holes are punched haphazardly. There were hanging tabs that didn't punch all the way out. There were ridges where the punching was uneven around the hole so that the paper sticks on the three ring binder.

Lastly if you are a lefty this is just plain useless.",1
"Every 5th and 6th sheet in the packages I received is not hole punched.  Talk about inconvenient.  The paper is very thin and I guess I am not used to buying paper but it is so slippery that it is hard to write on.  I know that sounds silly, but I guess the quality is very inexpensive.",1
"Not Panasonic's most well made product. Started having issues after 2 months, speaker phone stopped working, buzz on the phone, volume button 'froze'. Was on my husband's desk, replaced it with an AT&T model which is still perfect after a year. Would not recommend this Panasonic model phone.",1
Was dead on arrival.,1
No Caller ID!  This phone is really obsolete and the display is very difficult to read.  I would not recommend this phone.,1
"I bought this to use in my home office as a safer alternative to wireless phones that emit radiation. Unfortunately, with a headset plugged in I had to be speaking directly at the phone and callers told me I sounded like I was talking in a tunnel. Sadly, I have to give it away as it's a sub-par product even though I think Panasonic overall make the best phones.",1
"I used to have this fax machine at my former office and it was a great piece of office equipment.  When I went to my present place of employment, they used the same fax machine and it worked splendidly for about three and a half years.  Then it broke down and was replaced with the same model.  Only this new machine was endlessly frustrating.  When trying to fax something, it would invariably skew the paper and then jam.  It could take fifteen minutes to do a simple 1 or 2 page fax job.  After several months of trying to work with this machine, we changed it for a new copy of the same model, and guess what---we have the exact same problem!  The new fax machine also skews and jams paper.  I have no choice, having received 2 lemons in a row to conclude that this model has gone downhill in quality.  Not recommended.",1
"120 days later the dialing function no longer works. Very poor quality construction. Too bad, this was a nice phone initially.",1

Didn't work.,1
"I've ordered HP Cartridges from Amazon in the past.  I bought my last black #56 cartridge in August 2012.  In the past these cartridges have lasted about a year with the amount of printing I do.  This last one is only 2 month old and it's starting to run out of ink.  I'm sorry I didn't heed other reviewers.  I should have paid a little more money and bought the cartridge locally.

The Cartridge I bought had been made in Malaysia. I'm not sure how you can make sure where the product is made but other HP Cartridges I've bought online and locally have never failed like this one.  Amazon has stood behind this cartridge and made good on my purchase.",1
"i usually read all the reviews for the products I buy, but I never thought I'd have to read the reviews for a genuine HP printer cartridge!  Silly me, to think it would be a straightforward purchase.
As others have noted, I also received the HP 56b cartridge, and on googling the cartridge, it does say that it's for 'basic printing'.  What the heck does that mean?  I returned it, and will be buying the 2 pack, and hoping for the best this time.  I also bought it from Andrew's Printer Supply, or something like that, but it was FULFILLED BY AMAZON, so ultimately, I think it's Amazon's mistake.",1
"USES ONLY BATTERIES! Please note that this phone is reliant upon batteries to operate since it does not have an AC cord or any other type of electrical power source. Who runs a business on a battery operated landline? Makes no sense. I did not realize it when I purchased it since it's not written in the main description, where it should be.",1
"This is a phone from generations past.  There is no caller ID, for example.  We bought it to replace a similar Panasonic phone whose speaker died.  The old phone had caller ID.  Panasonic's customer service is terrible.  I was on hold for 3 hours and 40 minutes and had to hang up because I had to leave.  The next time I was on the phone for 90 minutes before I could reach somebody who was of no help.  Unfortunately, we were slow to install this and too late to return it.  It is worthless to us.",1
"Should have checked, no caller ID. Who would imagine in these days a phone without caller ID. Didn't notice until the phone rang. Since it was used already, couldn't return. waste of money.",1
"A month after purchasing this phone, the speaker, which was one of my main purchase issues, went out, also redial works when it feels like it, which is 2 out of ten times, there is an echo on this phone sometimes not too bad and sometimes I have to hang up and try calling back or using another phone.

I have always had great Panasonics in the past, but this is the third Panasonic that has been a waste of money. Their products are really going downhill.

Don't waste your time or money, look elsewhere.",1
"Ordered black,,,received ""tri-color"" --- also, this cartridge did NOT fit my HP printer (even though the webpage indicated it would fit my model)!  Amazon was great about the return,,but beware of the size/fit and ""color"" you may receive.  (Did not fit my HP 5600 series -- mine is many years old, and maybe that's why).---",1
"This was advertised as ""Retail Packaging"".  It was a Broither Drum in a Brother box.  HOWEVER, the box was not new appearing, and the foil wrapper of the drum was open.  It performed poorly, with light copies and stripes.  I strongly suspect that this was a ""refurbished"" drum put into a ""Retail Package"".  If this is the case, then this vendor should be barred from Amazon.",1
Software is no longer available for download from Memorex.  You can try to find it elsewhere...but likely will include malware.  Makes this a useless purchase....it's going back to Amazon.,1
This was the wrong item so I had to return it!  I did not like dealing with their phone service.,1
"The cartridge I received was a ""universal compatible cartridge"" not Brother OEM cartridge as advertised. It was hard to fit into the drum and has caused paper jams. For this price, buy genuine Brother cartridges.",1
"I think they're rotten, and they don't begin to compare in quality with my earlier, bona fide Memorex CD labels. The reason I say they're rotten is because the labels won't come off in one piece allowing me to center them very nicely on the CD/DVD, so it's made it a lot more work for me!",1
"I've used Memorex labels for years with good results. Recently I purchased a new computer and needed to download the Memorex label software. I went to the ""Memorex.com/labelmaker"" website that's printed on the labels and got this message: o results for term 'labelmaker'. The Memorex web site has no contact information for customer support. They have information for their other products, but nothing for labels. I Googled ""Memorex label software"", etc. and could only find third party sites - nothing I would trust to download. So I'm concluding that Memorex no longer supports their labels. Memorex has abandoned a product line and dumped their customers. They've lost this one for sure!",1
"I purchased this with the Epson XP310 photo printer.  It was actually part of a large mother's day gift.  You can click on my profile to see the review of the printer which explains how bad the photo prints came out.  The paper itself is not matte and not glossy, but it isn't the same paper as professional lustre paper either (and notice the two are spelled differently).  I have several professional photos that I have printed at a professional printer on lustre paper.  There is simply no comparison.  Between the cost of the ink and the cost of the paper, these are about $3-4 per page to print.  At a professional print shop they are $4-5.  The difference in quality is dramatic.  I think I would've had the same quality prints on any photo paper.  Not ultra and not premium except for cost.

Half of the pages I printed (all photos) had a circle ""spot"" on them about halfway down the page about a third of the way in from the right side.  This spot is about 3/4 inch in diameter so it's pretty large and very noticeable in any photo you print.  Half of the package defective is an awfully large percentage.

I won't be buying Epson products anymore.  And I won't be trusting Amazon's reviews which are staggeringly in favor of this sub-standard paper.  As long as sellers are allowed to harass people into removing negative reviews you just won't be able to find trustworthy products on Amazon anymore.",1
The software didn't work... it wouldn't even install but Amazon gave me a refund.,1
"WTF! I spent over an hour trying to figure out how to use this piece of cr*p software. I finally get to the point of printing it and cannot find the print template - ANYWHERE in what was provided. I call Avery and spent near to 15 minutes waiting in the cue. When I get the rep she says something like, ""Yes. It's no longer used. You have to go on line and use the software on line."" Are you kidding me?!?!? Then after I have to learn and waste time on yet another piece of cr*p software I go to print. On the box it says it is for laser and ink jet. Well, it isn't for laser because it smeared as it was pulling through. So, I hope the president of A-very cr*ppy company that doesn't care about the products it produces reads this.
Dear Avery, if I ever buy one of your products again it will be a cold day in hell. You have wasted my time. You have wasted my energy. You don't give a rip about what you put on the shelves for sale so long as you make that sale. I hope you find yourself in the same boat one day having bought  a product, expecting that it will work the way it says on the box, only to find that it doesn't AND THE COMPANY KNOWS!",1
"I have always used this brand, however the most recent ones I purchased seem to be much heavier and they will not work in my HP Envy printer.  Very disappointed.",1
"If I had known that CD Stomper was made by Avery I wouldn't have bought it and that must be the reason it's not listed on the box, (except in very small letters at bottom of box in copyright info). Avery software is a disaster on MAC OS X. I find it close to impossible to print Avery's own CD and CD templates properly using my trusty Canon MX-850. The software is next to impossible to use and I can't get Avery's labels to line up properly when printing them. Furthermore I just uninstalled their faulty software from my Mac earlier today. Luckily I read all the other bad reviews before opening the box. I will return this kit tomorrow for a refund. Lastly I do recommend purchasing Disc Cover 2 software from Amazon. DiscCover works very well with Mac OS X and it's affordable, reliable software that prints almost every brand of CD,DVD,VHS template i can think of. I just wanted the CD stomper itself for aligning labels with CD's but I will now purchase NEATO or MAXELL for that purpose. WARNING, MAC owners stay away from AVERY because they don't seem to give a damn about the quality of their defective products!",1
"Item is already broken, gel is coming out of the front of the pad, I'm past the return timeframe so it's going in the trash.",1
The product was broken when I received it so I am unable to use it and I would have requested a new one but it's to stressful to try to get through the red tape of exchanges!,1
Cheaply made.  I don't care for it.,1
This product is horrible... I want my money back...,1
"There were all these bad reviews about this thing not being able to hold a book. Fine, I thought. I don't need it to hold a book. I only need it to hold a piece of paper. It won't. It won't even stay put. Both the front and the back pieces slide down no matter what position you put them in, whether you have anything in it or not. I can't believe amazon even sells this junk.",1
"Despite the name, this is clearly not designed for ANY books (thick or thin), and I have found it not very useful for copy  either as the top clip does not grip at all.  Its very light and compact, but does not lock into place, no base weight or rubber base to prevent constant slipping and collapsing.",1
These are way too flimsy to survive USPS. Unfortunately I waited too long to try them & now it is too late to return otherwise I would. VERY DISSATISFIED!!!,1
"Produces sturdy postcards with excellent print quality.  The perforations generally tear cleanly, out of about 80 printed cards, I had two that didn't separate perfectly.  These are for inkjet, so any images and text look really nice and crisp.  That said, these are pretty heavy, and almost have a glossy finish, which made it hard for my Epson printer to feed reliably.  I managed to print off 20 sheets, but had quite a few misfeeds getting the job done.  Overall, a quality product at a good price.

Update - used 80 of these postcards for RSVP and many have been delivered with damage.  It seems like the card separates layers during the postal handling.  Most cards have come back fine, about 20 have been damaged badly, and what worries me is ones we'll never get due to damage that renders the address unreadable by the post office.  I have to rate these as unacceptable and I can't recommend you purchase for mailing.",1
"BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU BUY!  i needed inkjet, bought laser by pure accident. They are not interchangeable.  This package is LASER  not INK JET.This company  has a terrible return policy.  I ended up wasting $13 for nothing.",1
"All the writing flaked off and there were permanent dents which, at first, I thought would go away.  This was to replace the same model I bought years ago, but that was much better made and lasted 6 or 7 years until I accidentally punctured.  I'm surprised at the extraordinary drop in quality.",1
"only .5"" high not .9""

other than obvious lack of function due to height, the material is good, no leaks, does not stiffen up over time, no bad smell

Innovera is a better brand",1
"I have two Fellowes gel wrist rests that were purchased at least three years ago. They are used every day and are still in excellent condition. The new one, which I have had for only a few months and have used very little, is already starting to show signs of wear. The gel is permanently indented where my left wrist rests. The new wrist rest is approximately half as thick as my old ones and the gel feels much softer. Very disappointing.",1
"Yesterday I hauled this printer to the basement, repacked it and put it on a shelf for storage - the garbage would probably have been a more appropriate place.

This is without a doubt the noisiest printer I have ever owned or used. It start feeding the paper with a 'clunk' and the actual printing is a loud buzz, almost like an old dot matrix type printer. During printing it jiggles back and forth and I could actually feel the vibrations if I had my hand on top of my desk. When done it spits the paper out almost to the end of the paper catch tray.

The Dura-Brite ink is sharp and durable, it won't spot or run if you happen to get a drop of liquid on the print, but the  ink cartridges do not seem to last very long and are rather expensive.

After about a year of use I had my first big problem, the black ink wouldn't print. I went through the head cleaning process a couple of times trying to fix it, boy does that ever suck-out the ink, but it didn't help. I called Epson and they would have been happy to analyze the problem, if I wanted to pay them. The tech rep did give me a hint at no cost though - remove the cartridge and turn off the printer for 24 hours. He told me if the printer is left on it has a tendency to 'drown' and jam the heads. He recommended turning the printer on only when I was ready to print and leaving it off when not in actual use. Isn't that convenient - I would have to wait for the printer to go through the the charging cycle whenever I wanted to print something. I did this for a while but got tired of going through this hassel and began leaving it on. Oooppps!

The problem with the black ink began again recently. I put in a new cartridge and that did not help. Then the other three cartridges went out. I cleaned the heads and printed a test and a blank sheet of paper came out. Tried it again with same non-results.

Don't waste your money on this printer, it is frustrating, expensive and unreliable. I am not criticizing all Epson products, my first printer was an Epson C60 which worked fine and one of our printers in the office I work in is a C62 which has given us 2+ years of good performance. It is just this particular model that stinks.

STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS - AND BELIEVE ME THE COSTS WILL BE GREAT!",1
"I've had a few Epson printers over the years, and have been very happy with them.  This one is the exception.  As other reviewers noted, it worked fine for about a year with light use.  Then the print head simply died.  The other HUGE problem with this printer is that somehow, the ink dries out unless you use it every other day or so.  The cartridges, all Epson cartridges,  dried up on me far too quickly. I was replacing ink every three to four weeks, with very little printing.  Unacceptable.  I've had such a bad experience with this printer that it's put me off of the Epson brand entirely.",1
"If I could rate this 0 stars, I would have.  It stopped printing after changing the ink cartridges the 2nd time.  I've moved on to HP, as it's got such a great reputation.  My mother bought her Epson C82 the same day as me and hers died about a month before mine did.  Same thing...just stopped printing.  Save your money.",1
"This item is not as pictured. It lacks the beautiful distressed tan color. It's just plain dark brown. And if you return it, you will be charged shipping plus a 15% restocking fee. You will be charged for their inaccurate description.",1
"I purchased Versacheck 2008.  I've put up with the annoying serial number entries, and nag boxes to buy MICR ink from them.
I put in the serial code for this refill pack, and let it validate the code with the G7 servers.  All of the sudden, the software put up a big warning box, forcing me to upgrade.  I clicked ""no"", and the software stopped working.

Turns out the FTC hit Versacheck with a big fine.  Now they are required to verify funds before printing checks.  This is the source of these ""phone home"" complaints you see on the other reviews.  I didn't learn this after waiting 30 minutes on hold; I learned this talking to a competitor.  The G7 rep basically read me the script from the warning box, and offered to sell me the new software.  No thank you.

I'm done giving G7 productivity money.  If you're willing to pay about $100, you can have over a thousand checks pre-printed for quickbooks, for the exact same price per check as Versacheck charges for blanks.  And that ends up costing less, because you're not picking up G7Prod's slightly overpriced blank checks, and you're not paying for G7Prod's really expensive MICR toner or ink, and you're not buying G7prod's really expensive, and increasingly invasive check printing software.

Once you have the pre-printed checks, just stick them in your printer, and use quickbooks to print the checks directly.  No more waiting for the virtual printer to load or clicking all sorts of unnecessary dialog boxes to print a darn check.

If you're not willing to consider that, you can try MultiChax.  It's the fugliest looking software I've seen since MS-DOS, but the people seem to be friendlier.",1
I had this one 9 months and it blew up Now i know why. When they are low on ink you have to replace them immediately. I went through 2 Samsungs ina year without realizing this. They take a long time to warm up also The size is great and i like the front loading for paper so i cna see what I am doing while sitting down. The toner is horribly expensive and you don't get the amount they say If you use the device to save toner you cant read the page. I wanted to let anyone know that  you have to keep your eye on the ink because ther eis no warning you need ink,1
"Similar to other reviews, the Avery Magnet Sheets we received were extremely disappointing. The magnet sheets are very thin and wouldn't stick to the refrigerator or car bumper. They are not magnetic at all... Unfortunately, we would not be able to use them for their intended purpose.",1
Garbage. Nothing sticks. Peeling the adhesive backing is impossible. It does not tear clean. It leaves behind a ton of paper residue. DO NOT BUY THESE,1
"So, despite the negative reviews, I purchased this product thinking that it would be decent for me.  My printer (hp 5150 inkjet) handled the magnet sheets just fine.  However, if you plan to cut it, be warned.  First of all, anything smaller than about 3 inches has a VERY hard time sticking under it's own weight.  Second, they curl after being cut.  Third, if bent, there is no hope for them to stick.  I wanted to use these on a paper steel product that has a very thin polylaminate film finish on it.  However, that is out of the question.  They do not stick at all -- even the larger cuts have difficulties.  I found the glossy Office Depot brand a bit more useful and better than the Avery brand.  The Office Depot brand (glossy) works, but not ""great"".  I ordered a sample pack from MagnetValley, and I was quite pleased with the glossy magnet sheet.  It worked well in my printer and has the greatest sticking power.

Unfortunately, the Avery brand really disappointed me.  I love Avery labels, and I thought the other reviews were being overly critical... then I tried the product.  The other negative reviews are right on!  Don't waste your money on this product.  You will be disappointed.",1
"I ALWAYS buy Avery stuff to use, and thought it would just be easier to get it on Amazon rather than go to the office supply store. I did not get the blue and yellow package, I received two beat up off-white packages (that looked like they'd been opened before and with tattered corners) with EVERYTHING labeled in Spanish. Then when I opened them, they weren't heavyweight at all. They were flimsy and barely thicker than a regular piece of paper. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE, perhaps if they were the actual ones that I thought I was getting I could rate them higher.

So shoddy that I have to return it.  The shelf and the frame are misaligned.  There are bubbles in the paint.  There are dents in the shelf.  And this is supposed to be new?  It's a piece of garbage.  Do not.,1
Manufacturing defect on one leg. Deformed end of metal footing is sharp and does not hold the plastic end cap securely. I returned the item.,1
My mother uses her Brother typewriter to write letters - no email for her.  The last one of these developed broken letters after 3 months and the previous one didn't last much longer.  Definitely not a quality product now that there isn't any competition or much demand.,1
"Returned immediately because these are FAR from being ""CLEAR"". More like looking through frosted glass if you want a reference.",1
"These are good quality stickers, but they aren't clear. Normally I would have given them a 3, maybe even a 4, but every sheet in the pack I bought had what looks like hair embedded between the label and backing of the corners.",1
"Tried printing images on these, failed miserably.  The printer made noises I never heard before.  The printed page was ruined about halfway through but kept printing.  The blank didn't like being fed into the printer, and it didn't like coming out.  All in all, a waste of time and money.  Will try to print just text next time, hopefully that will work.",1
"If the windshield on my Toyota fit this description of clear, I would have to extend my head out the drivers side window to see were I was going. I spend a lot of time preparing art. I order my materials in advance to meet my schedule. This misleading description has stopped my project in it's tracks.

I am returning this order and another (different size) for credit.

Avery needs to re-think this description.",1
This was not in retail packaging and did not work at all.,1
"This item was listed as being able to buy it, but when I ordered it, it was out of stock.",1
Fell apart very quickly.  Only a few months of use and i had to already replace it.,1
Had to return them  Impossible to tear apart - very disappointing for an Avery product.  NOT recommended.,1
"These are the WORST Avery Business Cards I have EVER purchased!  They don't break-apart and I had to trim each and every page.  I would highly recommend that you NOT buy this particular product.  I've used many, many of Avery products before and this was such a disappointment.  I wouldn't give it even one star--if I had a choice!

Unfortunately, we purchased 100 sheets of this junk.  I will actually just buy a different card and take the loss--rather than use these again.  The time it took to trim 14 pages/sheets of cards make buying a different type of card worth it.",1
"I thought these were the Avery 8371 Model but found that they have the micro perforation, and don't come clean when separating the cards.  I advise that the cards are not the way to go
I started using the ""Clean Edge"" Avery's, but found  they were about 20% more expensive than the Avery 8371 model, so i have returned since they also have the clean edge, except if you get a little over zealous when separating them.",1
Too small. This was not high enough for my wrist,1
"Has the ""worn out"" ""faded"" by the sun look. Cheap and would not buy again.",1
"I purchased two of these and sadly will have to leave a 1. The ink cartridge is meant to last for all  photos ,but unfortunately it ran out after only 25 photos. It is not the fault of the seller instead it's Canon. It's also not possible to purchase ink separately.",1
"This thing went flat the first time I used it. I thought it would expand back to its original shape over night, but it did not. It has about zero density, and is now about as flat as a pancake.",1
"This item is nicely spongy, but poorly made.  Within just a few weeks, the glue on the fabric disintegrated and the entire thing came apart.  Very annoying.  I've replaced it with the 3m gel pad, which appears to be indestructible, if not as soft.",1
"Lasts about a month.  Mashes down in the middle and it can get a bit hard feeling in colder temps.  When it is warm (e.g. the summer), it does OK.

I haven't experienced the leaks as others have reported, but only been using it for a month.

Update (4 months of use):  I've gone down to one star (from 2).  Still hasn't leaked, but it is now seriously deformed in the middle and no longer soft.  Belkin support is non-existent.  Recommend finding a different brand (I'm going to try Allsop next).",1
"only .5"" high not 1""
fabric is not durable, wears through and hard to keep clean

other than obvious lack of function due to height, no leaks, does not stiffen up over time

Innovera is a better brand",1
"I bought this product and wish I never did. The labels never stick to the envelope. They start peeling immediately no matter what kind of envelope I use. I have to tape down the label every time I use one. Well, at least I only have oh, 500 labels to go. Not recommended!!!",1
"I thought I'd be getting a funtional machine, but it literally doesn't record messages of 10 seconds or less. This is an impossible situation for those who sometimes get short messages as you will not even know you received them!
I'm going to try to return it.",1
"DON'T BUY IT! MINE IS ON IT'S WAY BACK! NO CHIRPS, NO BEEPS, NO SOUND OF ANYKIND. INSTRUCTIONS DONE VERY CHEAPLY..SMALL RECTANGLE TO UNFOLD INTO TWO SIDED LARGE PIECE OF PAPER WITH NO ORDER OF HOW TO  TO  FINISH SET UP!!! MINE DID NOT WORK. I DID NOT READ THE REVIEWS  ""BEFORE"" I BOUGHT...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.",1
"very diffcult to position in comfortable way, was very disappointed",1
"distributes too much at a time, hard to use, returned for credit",1
"I write with my pen almost daily for class notes and homework. The pen writes really smooth when the refill is new, but it quickly starts getting rough. The ink doesn't flow out easily after only a week or two of use. So rough that my cheap zebra pen felt luxurious compared to this refill on my cross pen. Wiping the ball point clean with a wet finger helps alleviate the rough-ness, but it doesn't last. Very dissatisfied with cross ink cartridges. Both refills suffered from this. Did I get something defective, or are people convincing themselves that this is a quality product, deserving of a high rated review?",1
"Bought these as replacements for my cross pen and initially they worked but after a few uses the refill started to skip and then failed after a while. Will not purchase these again, I will instead stick to my fountain pens which work better.",1
"This is the refill that Cross puts in its SelecTip pens and I have acquired a lot of them. My experience is the same with each pen, and it is not pretty.

Skips. Smearing. Bleeding across the paper. A terrible experience.

The Cross jumbo ballpoint refill is decent. This one is not.",1
"I bought these to go with a new Cross pen.  I've used these pens for years and remember a nice quality ink.

When I replaced my current cartridge for the fine point, this ink immediately blotted.  YUCK!

I contacted Amazon for a return.

I can't recommend these - made in China - cartridge refills.  DEFINITELY not the quality I remember or the quality of the original ink that came in the pen.",1
"OK so I drank the kool-aid and bought this ""special"" oil with my new heavy-duty shredder from Amazon.  After unpacking the shredder, I noticed a little warning label on top that says not to use petroleum based lubricants.  This got me curious as to what the magic Fellowes oil was actually made of.  Some quick web searching let me to the LifeHacker article which has a link to the actual MSDS for this product on Fellowes' own web site.  Turns out, this stuff is listed as >99% (that's *greater than* 99 percent) CANOLA OIL!  I mean, anyone can do the math at this point, right?  I guess that's what's so special about this oil -- they wave their magic Jedi mind trick wand, and we buy repackaged cooking oil at a huge ""special"" profit for Fellowes.  Hence the 1-star review.",1
Mostly dry ink.,1
"Cross used to be the best and that is all I would ever buy, but now it just isn't the same quality anymore. It never worked well from the beginning and just streaks ink across the page, so I got another one and the same thing with that one. I hope they return to quality, but in the meantime I won't be buying anymore.",1
"This ink appears red in color, not burgundy. It isn't blue enough. Google Image Search ""burgundy"" and look at the results; this ink won't look like that.

Anyone specifically buying burgundy ink expects it to look noticeably different from normal red ink. This hue has no such effect.

The quality of the product is great but the color is wrong. Save a few dollars and go with black or blue instead.",1
For the money I was very disappointed. Who cares if it writes under water and in space. It doesn't write on earth. Inconsistent flow. Buy the Schmitt easy flow 9000 they're amazing.(on earth),1
"believe I cancelled this order as the freight cost was prohibitive.

"Fellows oil has severely gummed up my Fellows shredder. A close examination of the plastic surrounding the blades reveals actual plastic deterioration. I mean the plastic will gum off if attempting to clean oil off of same. It's a mess. Hey, any vegetable based oil, regardless of Fellows monkeying around with it, turns rancid if opened for a year. Also, oil that does not eventually wear off with use remains and becomes gummy! Then what? Does one buy more inflated Fellows oil? There has got to be an intelligent answer to this. There is not one offered here. Be careful what lube you use.",1
"I purchased this product new from Amazon in 2013. One side of the stabilizers that hold the white board to the frame was always a little loose, but still held it ok. Recently it has become more and more loose. I took the side tightening discs off to see if I could adjust them, and found that one of the discs had a crack on the inside, that had been taped to keep it from being completely useless.
Now if there had just been the crack, I might believe that I tightened it too much or it failed over time, but the tape is on one side only, and the other piece is whole with no cracks.
This may have been a return that QC didn't catch, or the fault of an individual or department that cut corners, but the bottom line is this was advertised as brand new, and was sold as a refurbished item.
Too late to send it back now, so I will re-tape it and live with the broken part.
To Amazon's credit, this is a rare occurrence. I've purchased several thousand dollars worth of merchandise directly from Amazon, and only a few times have I had issues.",1
"The white board part of it may be nice, but no matter how hard I tried and tightened the locks, the back leg would slip out.

I could not get it to stand up while writing on it.

I don't think the plastic locks are strong enough.  Maybe mine is defective, but I'm guessing, it is just poor design.",1
I may be able to write in space with this refill but it was a disappointment for earthly writing. I bought this Fisher refill for one of my Parker Jotter pens. I replaced it with a standard Parker refill after about ten minutes. The Fisher refill required more effort to write with and the line weight was terribly. I do not recommend and I will not purchase again.,1
"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil, but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money, but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together, when they cannot be, especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically.",1
"These are like writing with a tacky black crayon. If I wanted to work to write, I'd carry a hammer and chisel to scribe. (Any suggestions for when one doesn't use a gel pen, as they don't play nice with thinner pages?)",1
Four star rating.  Should have puchased the larger bottle of oil when I purchased the shredder.  No problems and keeps shredding chugging along.,1
"It is just vegetable oil.... it's better to use a light sewing machine or light gun oil, like Hoppe's Lubricating Oil.

[...]",1
"They are not currency bands.  They are flat pieces of scrap paper, with a hint of adhesive in the wrong place.  They can be carefully folded over bills to make misprinted bands, that barely hold together, but they are not bands.  The markings of where to fold them are not correct.  The adhesive almost useless.  The strips are mis-printed with the wrong registration.

Not worth returning.  Spit on a piece of paper and you will have about the same thing.",1
Keeps breaking easily!,1
Arrived broken. Had to throw away.,1
"I was about to buy this for my Fellowes Powershred W-11C 11 Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder I bought here on amazon but did some searching since I've had my other cheapo Walmart shredder for 5 years and just use olive oil on it. I found the MSDS for this and the only listed chemical is more than 99% canola oil!!!! So buyer beware, you can either spend $7 for 12 oz of canola oil or spend 98 cents on 32 oz of the stuff at any grocery store. I soak a piece of paper with it, run it through the machine before shredding and at every basket full. Like I said, I've had my $20 Walmart shredder for 5 years and this has been my method, I plan on doing this with my way more expensive Fellowes cross cut shredder.",1
"[...]
I read this in a review and sure enough this oil is canola oil.  Expensive canola oil and probably not deodorized like cooking canola oil.  But it is Canola oil.  This oil has gummed up my shredder and now the lever that should pop up after paper goes thru is stuck in the down position and so the shredder does not automatically turn off.",1
Refill arrived leaking ink ! Threw it away !,1
Gave it to the Goodwill,1
"Sorry, but this is a cheap piece of crap.  It's very light, and that makes it way too easy to kick out of position.  The unit comes with small rubber feet that are inserted into holes on the bottom - supposedly to make it less likely to slip.  My office has that low-pile ""rug"" so typical of many, so I thought these would help.  Nope, if I apply the slightest pressure on the foot rest it slips forward and the rubber feet pop right out.  If they were more substantial and held on by screws that would be much better.  I may try superglue, but seriously you have to wonder if people every try using what they sell.",1
Fell right off the wall about an hour after putting it up. Disappointing.,1
"Lack of quality.  Two pieces of cheap plastic.  Upper part lays loosely on the bottom piece and can shift off at any time. I would return this item BUT, I was only allowed HALF the cost of what I paid as a refund.  Not worth the bother to return it, gas to take it to UPS.  Paid $16 would have been refunded $8.  Not worth the cost.  I would look for a better foot rest even at a higher cost.",1
"I am usually pretty effusive in my reviews on Amazon, but I can't sing the praises of this footrest.  It is adjustable, yes, but it cannot be locked into one position, which I only discovered after it had arrived.  And since I wanted this to place a foot pedal on and didn't want to have to chase that foot pedal as it rocked back and forth on the foot rest... well, this was a mighty big fail.  I had to improvise a way to lock it in position and was pleased that I could do that, but then those ""foot massage"" bumps on it were AWFUL and painful and would leave depressions in my feet.  Ouch.  So I had to tape heavy corrugated cardboard onto the foot rest to soften those bumps all over it, and when that didn't do the trick enough, I took a length of that spongy shelf liner and put several layers of that onto this footrest.  Finally, it didn't dig into my feet.  And then I had to secure it to the carpet by blocking it off with spacers between it and the wall, which kept it stationery because without spacers it slid, even on carpeting.  I am only detailing all the modifying I had to do, Dear Reader, because if you're like me and was looking for a foot rest that was, you know, RESTFUL and not a big pain to use, then you might want to bypass this one and buy something else.",1
"The foot rest is moving too much freely without locking position, and in low quality. This item is not recommended to back-pain person due to lack of locking position, which makes back-pain worse.",1
"This organizer is awesome IF, and I stress IF, it fit in my drawer properly.  I ignored all the reviews below saying it was too tall to fit in a normal letter file-sized desk drawer, thinking they weren't putting it in properly or perhaps they had some weird desk, but NO.  Please listen to the reviews and see that it really IS too tall to close your drawer properly.  I can close my drawer if I shove it, but then it sticks in there and I'm always struggling with it.  It is annoying, since the only thing that keeps this from being awesome is these unnecessary handle bumps on the side. I'd suggest you have an inch of clearance between the top of the drawer sides and the top of the drawer slot hole on your desk to make this fit in properly.  Or if you own a table saw you can saw off 1/4 inch from the top of the handle things and then it would fit fine.",1
I recieved this item slightly dented and missing the drawer,1
"I love this caddy, it's well made, all the welds seem right BUT the drawer was missing which is a big deal. After diving into the other reviews more I see I am not alone. Now I have to box it up, print a label and go to the UPS store to return it. Huge hassle for a -$10 item. BAD attention to detail.",1
The rolodex tag is crooked and the drawer's front is misshapen.  The drawer doesn't sit flush in its slot.  Poor quality.,1
"Originally, I have written a good review: ""I have got this thing to use in the  office, I like my feet elevated. It has two height settings, so it is even more convenient than it looks. I personally like it a lot.""

However after just a couple months of using this thing, I pierced it with my heel very easily, and I didn't put a lot of weight on it. It's very fragile and won't work for girls in heels. Very disappointed.",1
Mesh came broken and entire business card holder is a little bent out of shape.,1
Product arrived damaged. Or the staples used in manufacturing were substandard. What a mess. See pics,1
"I am quite disappointed in this Rubbermaid Hanging Drawer Organizer.  I just purchased a new desk and the two drawers on the right side are both deep file drawers.  I am right handed and always keep my desk accessories in the right hand top drawer so I was hoping this would work for me. Unfortunately it does not!  Nothing I have fits in this tray.  Not my stapler, not my tape dispenser, not my calculator, not my scissiors!  Nothing other than a letter opener, normal length pens, a couple of sizes of post-it pads, annd perhaps loose paper clips (I have a separate magnetic dispenser that is better anyway)!  The material is hard shinny plastic so it has no feel, is noisy, and slides around too easy.  It also would cost more to return than it is worth.  Luckily I also ordered a Madesmart 3 X 15 X 11-1/2-Inch Junk Drawer Organizer in the same order.  It fills my left hand top drawer nicely, holds everything the Rubbermaid tray would not hold, and the Maidsmart is made of a nicer material, which does not slide around, is quiet, and has a nice softer surface feel.  The Madesmart-like quality is much more like what I expected from Rubbermaid.",1
Flimsy and unattractive.,1
Dont advertise something as unbreakable when its clearly a flimsy product that has broken in numerous places. Will go with a better product next time.,1
"This looks nice, but does not even hold itself up by the super weak magnet.",1
Definitely breakable.,1
GARBAGE!  Fell and broke 2 seconds after putting it up.  Nothing was in it.  Put on a metal file cabinet.  Waste!,1
Does not fit in File Cabinet Drawer,1
This is flimsy junk that is not the brand described. One side of the mesh was dented and my standard letter size file folders have to be slid on at a slight angle. Very unhappy with this item.,1
"I was very disappointed when this brand new item came with the top shelf noticeably bent (something that they should have caught, stopping it from being sent out, if there was any ""quality control"" in place). There was no packaging other than clear plastic around it, so even a visual inspection of it would've caught this and stopped them from sending it out (hopefully!).

The metal is soft enough to move easily, not solid like I'd hope shelves like this would be. But still, I couldn't bend it back so that the indentation in the shelf would go away, and it's still ""bendy"" (flexible) in an undesirable way.  This means that when I put something on it such as a pen holder, it does not sit level, and looks bad as well as not sitting firmly when I put it if others things move around (as they can tend to do when you use various things on your desk). So, the problem is not only the dented top (horizontal, as shown in the default photo) shelf, but also just the unstable, unfirm nature of the mesh shelves in general.

In general, this is a simple object with no moving parts, seemingly without much to say about it beyond what you can see. But I've found that the shelves that constitute the horizontal shelves in that default view (which is how I have mine sitting) being so soft and flexible is a major flaw, given that one of the major desirable (so I thought) aspects of the design for me, at least, was that the top shelf could be used for things that it turns out won't sit firmly and reliably in place there. There's really no reason to buy one of these if you don't plan to put things on that surface, so this matters. Things like staplers, pen holders, etc. that aren't lightweight should be able to sit there without sitting askew and being at risk of sliding due to the unstable and uneven surface, and it should allow your desk to look tidy and professional, especially if used in an office setting. This looks professional in the photos, but doesn't on my desk due to this flaw.

When you consider the price for this simple object with no moving parts, just a hunk of metal basically, it really should be better built, with better quality control (and maybe putting it in a box could prevent some of the bent units such as mine arriving bent?), or else it should be less expensive. The materials used in it, as well as any possible R&D or design costs, can't justify the final price being as high as it is. That relation between price and what you get for your money was surely a major consideration in my choice of only one star (and the fact that it arrived damaged was also obviously a factor).

I'm sure many are sent out without being bent like mine was. But I'm also sure mine isn't the ONLY one that's sent bent like that. So, it's a gamble in that respect (with the general flaw noted above being there for anyone, of course, even if not bent). And given the cost and the hassle of returning it, I didn't find it worth returning. After having it for some time, though, I wish I had returned it right away anyway, while I still had the original packaging handy. At this point, it'd be too much trouble for too little of a refund, although my experiences with having to return items to Amazon have been positive thus far (they've sent a prepaid label, and I just had to repackage the item with all its original contents). This thing didn't come with anything, by the way (no box around it, no paper other than labels stuck onto it that I three away). So if you get one of the bent ones, I recommend returning it ASAP, before you throw out (recycle, hopefully) the stuck-on labels, plastic bag it comes in, and the box & packaging materials.

I should probably note that at first, I tried putting it in all of its various possible orientations, since you can make a few different surfaces the ""bottom."" But having it upright to the greatest degree, with what's the side when looking at the default (1st) photo of it as the bottom, it didn't sit very stably. It was just too unstable to use that way, imo, and it's also not all that useful because when in that orientation, paper or file folders in the upright slots would have to fill the slots in order to keep the contents from folding down or bending due to their own weight, and being vulnerable to coming out of the slots entirely. Thus, while they claim it can rest on the sides, it's not really a viable option.

Last, in case you hadn't thought it through, note that if you have this on a desk (as opposed to a shelf, for example), you either can't have anything in front of this unit if you want ot use the bottom shelf or shelves, or else you have to just plan to not use the bottom shelves at all. That makes the design a poor fit for your purposes, of course. If you can't use the bottom shelves because they require you to not use the desktop in front of it so you can access those shelves, then there's surely another organizer that's better designed for your purposes. This design really makes sense only as a shelf unit, imo, since those bottom shelves take up not only the space of the unit itself, but also of any desk or tabletop area in front of it so you can put things in the bottom shelves and take things out of them. I actually didn't think that through well enough, which is why I mention this. I had to create a block (stack of books in my case, which I can't use now) to elevate the unit high enough so that I could use the desk space in front of it since my space is too limited to give that space up.

And if you do get one of these, good luck getting one that isn't bent irrecoverably upon deliver like I did!",1
"It was great at first.  Less than a month of use, the magnets fell off.  I used it as a classroom ""drop box"" for student notes.  There was never over 20 sheets of regular paper inside.",1
"Came bent, no drawer bins.",1

Broken when taken out of box,1
not a good quality.  Does not worth the money.,1
These bags are produced by the manufacturer of my Fellowes shredder and are specifically recommended for the model I own. The bags are flimsy. They do not fit the shredder properly. They always fall into the shredder bucket. I will never buy Fellowes shredder bags again.,1
"Be careful! I bought a this ""like new"" file holder from the warehouse and the it was broken when I got it :( #Annoying",1
"THESE BAGS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THIS SHREDDER.

I have a new SB-89Ci shredder.  These bags are supposed to fit the shredder (according to Fellowes).  The bags which came with the shredder are great - but those are NOT thse bags.

These are too small and are also so thin that I don't think they are useful for any medium-duty shredder.  If I had a considerably smaller shredder they might work, but for the one I have, they are a waste of money.

I've just returned the box of them which I bought from Amazon.

To be completely accurate, it IS possible to stretch them to fit the shredder; however, if you do that, you can't keep the waste bin IN the shredder unless you hold it there, and they tear quickly when stretched like that.  So they are useless.",1
"Are you kidding me? I get a bag full of shredded paper and they're flimsy already but then I go and pull them out and they get caught inside the machine and tear down the side, what's the point? I wish I could get my money back on these things because they are GOD AWFUL! I now use Costco trash compacter bags that fit perfectly and don't tear when you pull them out, a little more expensive but worth it. Probably more plastic in ONE compacter bag than in 100 of these stupid bags.",1
"I had the same thing happen as the first one star reviewer, I cannot drill holes in my wall and that was why I got a wall file with adhesive strips. What a joke! They give you four adhesive strips, I cleaned the area and let it dry, put one adhesive strip on each side on the wall file and let that sit for 4 hours. I put put the wall file to wall (which is perfectly flat) and pressed for 30 seconds. 5 minutes later it fell off. I thought I did something wrong and I tried it again the next day in different place and it did it again. What is left of the adhesive is stuck on the wall and I can't get it off!",1
"These are ok, but they don't really fit well in to the collection area.  I'm sure you could find a better fitting bag.",1
I have a Fellows SB-97Cs and use tall kitchen bags.  They are more durable but do require a bit more care during installation.,1
"These bags are extremely thin and rip just trying to open the bag.  Not even good enough for a trash can, no less a shredder basket.  I switched back to just normal trash bags after just using 2 bags because they only ripped opened and then I had to use another bag anyway.",1
"I really wanted to like this, and overall it seems decent.  I would've given it five stars but it came WITHOUT the drawer compartment. Seeing as I purchased this strictly  for makeup, that drawer was integral to my storage plans. I ordered multiple things and searched every box that came, but there's no little drawer to be found. seriously frustrating.",1
"It arrived missing one letter of the alphabet--""A.""  Not a big problem.  This is only designed for inserting business cards, I had wanted to use it the same way as the old flip-them-forward standard Rolodex but with the recirculating wheel system.
Included cards are narrower than standard Rolodex cards, so the labels I print from my computer were too long and had to be modified by cutting them.  What a pain.
I think I am going to go to a different system and not use Rolodex at all.  These card carriers consist of a thin cellophane tube around a standard weight piece of paper, same as copier paper and seem very flimsy.  I don't see how they can hold up.
Rolodex seems to get a lot of money for very little value, check the price of refills of any kind for the system",1
Item Showed up without the Drawer as pictured.,1
"The item looked like it would be a nice organization system for my home office.  However,it could not be assembled because the threads on the unit were stripped, making it impossible to get the screws to go in.  Returned it.",1
"I ordered 4 of these items and all arrived chipped, broken, scratched, or damaged in some other way.  I will never order Quartet products again.",1
cap at end of rolodex fell off and cannot be reattached as the cheap plastic nub that holds it there snapped. waste of money,1
This is the worst Rolodex I have ever had.  Yeah it looks good but the inserts do not stay on and are flimsy and when you roll to the card you want it won't stay in place,1

This is a poorly designed product with very flimsy card stock and difficult to use. Don't buy it.,1
It's top heavy and clunky to use.  I gave it away and bought a different style.,1

"I love it! Great price and has worked good so far. :)

UPDATE: I had to drop my rating from a 5 star to a 1. I initailly bought this paper cutter to use for trimming prints of my artwork. When I first wrote my review - I had not used it for my art. Once I started using it on my artwork I noticed the measurements are significantly off. You can not use the rulers for accurate cutting. I honestly would have just adjusted and continued using it if that were the only problem. But, the blade doesn't even cut straight! It is very noticably uneven. So, unfortunately, this is now useless to me.",1

"Poorest quality I ever saw from Rolodex. The cards are thin paper and they are wrapped in an ultra thin plastic that is sealed at the bottom and has to be ripped open in order to use the paper. There is no ratchet on the handles like their older modes, so the cards all flop to the bottom rather than staying open where you want it. The only thing nice about it is the mahogany wood base.",1
"Cheap product, it was already broken when I opened the box.
Parts are glued cheaply.",1
"I was expecting a much smaller rolodex.  My desk  space is at a premium and I thought I was getting a small foot print when I brought this product.  As far as I know it appeared to be OK otherwise.  I ended up donating it to a charitable organization that a friend of mine worked at.  She told me that the one she used needed  to replaced, so that was easier then retuning it to Amazon.",1
"Very unsafe!
Cut paper in an inclined line not straight so the papers end up having white ages from at the end.",1
"These clips are smaller than the typical small size binder clip, and that limits their usefulness.",1
"This just seemed so cheap!  The cards are as thin as thin, thin paper and the clear protectors of each card are just a bother  clear protectors are a complete aggravation!  Not impressed at all!",1
When it arrived the front part of the holder was broken off.  It was poorly attached with glue only.,1
It doesn't cut evenly. Don't buy this!,1
"This little desk file holder looks so nice. The problem is that the dividers are so short that my regular letter sized folders fall forward. Notice in the picture that there is only a small item - so it doesn't fall forward.  Too bad, this is a nice, solid little organizer.",1
"Doesn't appear to be a ""real"" Rolodex product and not impressed with the workmanship of this product at all.  Products we own that are Rolodex are made much better.",1
This came broken. I don't know if this is a Rolodex problem or a Price Bully problem.,1
Does not cut thick paper evenly all the way. the item is made so cheaply that the plastic bends and it is hollow and thin. the blade wobbles and flex like a bow when cutting a few sheets together. this one for $40 is not worth the price ( cheap plastic+ blade=$10 worth),1
Horrible buy. I couldn't use it since it wasn't level.,1
Did not work even though it was the required ribbon for our printer.,1
flimsy not as good quality as indicated! will not recommend. put away under my bed after cutting 4 sheets of paper. Cuts crooked & do not use out of sight out of mind very dissatisfied.,1
"What a piece of junk, sorry I bought it",1
"I had a horrible experience with this company and for this product.  After ordering 13 of these two weeks ago, I only received 3. I had to call them approximately 5 times for them to tell me that we got the last 3 items!  They never called back when they said they would and Shoplet was a horrible company to work with.  DON'T DO IT!  Order through someone else at all costs!  When I told them how dissappointed I was, they did not care.  They said that had soooooo many customers.  It obviously does not effect them with their very poor customer service.",1
"It's hard to explain, but there is not divider behind the three shelves. The two openings on the outside have nothing between them on the inside so things don't really fit correctly. The little shelves are odd. Nothing really fits on them! I'm disappointed.",1
Unfortunately the arm falls very easy. they need another piece in the back.,1
Loose arm. The arm comes off very easy so it defeats the purpose,1
Beware: The arm falls off.,1
"Does not cut straight!! When making normal cuts, the material toward the end of the blade gets pushed up/lifts causing the cut to be uneven. Fisker makes one for a bit more that works much better and has a nice feature that holds down the paper close to the blade.",1
The arm fell off easy. That's the main reason I bought this for my kid but that arm keeps coming off.,1
The arm falls easily.,1
"I was so excited about this, but the arm keeps coming out which defeats the purpose of buying this expensive compass.",1
Broken arm...,1
"Cheaply made, color faded after 2 uses. Also, low precision.  Bought Incra instead.",1
"The product did not work. I would cut paper and the top half was sharp and cut nicely, but the bottom half would not cut at all and tore the paper. I notified the Swingline Company to see if I could get a replacement blade, but they are discontinued. Swingline sent me another trimmer and it works the way it is supposed to. I am very pleased that Swingline stands by their product, but I am very disappointed that I ordered a product from Amazon that did not do the job it was meant to do.",1
Poorly made.,1
Not a good product,1
"Yes, these are paperclips - just paperclips. They clip paper together - problem is they are no longer good quality paperclips.

I last ordered 3000 ACCO jumbo clips from Staples about 10-11 (???) years ago - the clips from back then [and I still have some for comparison] were a thicker [or stronger] wire gauge.

These new ACCO clips feel flimsy, they bend way to easily, almost like a Christmas tree ornament hanger.

Another example of saving a few dollars and making inferior quality products in China.

Will certainly avoid any ACCO product in the future - in fact will avoid any office product made in cheap-china.",1
"I ordered a record book and got a planner.  Not sure how to get what I ordered, but I must review this as 1 star (note that my reviews are typically 4-5 stars and I purchase a lot from Amazon.)",1
"Started out nice, smooth, and quiet. But after about 3 business days, it started squeaking like no body's business. Amazon, being awesome, replaced it free of charge without question. The second one too started out perfectly. However, about a week later, the squeaks and squeals have started all over again. Going to try another brand.",1
"They should be ashamed to have their name on this product.  I read the negative reviews before ordering and decided I could deal with the issues IF they were real.  The sorters arrived in a very large box with a lot of sealed air packets.  But there is no real packaging on the individual items.  The various parts were bent in various ways.  The metal isn't very hard to bend back to where it should be  but that shouldnt be necessary in the first place.  You cant tell how much of the damage took place in shipment, and how much was built-in from the factory in China (per the label).  The structure is one long U-shaped piece, with 2 shorter U-shaped sections spot-welded in between.  The product is probably hand-made in some sort of a fixture that aligns the narrow middle sections so they are spaced reasonably even and straight.  But the fixture doesnt assure that the middle sections are properly aligned front-to-back, and theres some sloppy work in that respect.  Its also amazing the product has no protective feet to prevent sliding and/or scratching the surface the sorter rests on  that would have maybe added 5 cents to the cost.

Im a retired engineer and pretty handy.  I'm also short on time to use the sorters.  So, Ill make-do with these, but have modified them by adding a small diameter split tube on the bottom wires as a surface protector.  Ive also added a thin upright piece of polycarbonate on the back (attached with small wire-ties) to stiffen the fins and hold them in place.  The polycarbonate also prevents things from falling out the back side of folders.

Overall, I give Rolodex an F- on this product, and will only look at their brand again if they are the only game in town.  But even then, expecting junk.  SAD!!!

Who knows what basis Amazon uses to give a product the Amazons Choice designation.  Certainly, Bezos isn't doing the job.  Its also sad that this product received that recognition  it has far less meaning to me now.",1
They are ok.,1
"I bought this and tested it with 10 sheets instead of the 15 advertised. It made a couple of complete cuts but then started crushing the bottom half of the paper rather than cutting it. After about half an hour trying to make it work, I sent it back for a refund",1
"Cuts great about 6 inches down your paper then it just bends, shreds and cuts crooked. I've tried everything to make it work but I think it's just not lined up causing it to screw up anything I cut. I wanted to love it but after 5 days of frustration and having to fix every paper I cut with scissors it's being returned.",1
"I needed to replace a paper cutter which lasted 25+ years. I should have read the three star review which mention it doesn't cut straight.  This is a nice looking and heavy made paper cutter.  My first problem was it's top heavy, when you lift the cutting arm it the whole paper cutter tips back.  So you have to hold the front bed of the paper cutter down as you lift the arm.  Ok but it does cut so no deal breaker .  After using for a few days I notice it wasn't cutting square.  I stuck a metal square on it and the top edge where you place the edge of the paper against isn't even straight. The top edge has a bow in it at the 2 inch mark. Placing the metal square its off 3/16 of an inch across the 12"" top edge.  Another poorly made in China to Swingline specifications piece of of junk.. No quality control.  Returning right now..",1
came with drawer missing.  i don't feel like messing with a return.  so i just got slightly hosed.  oh well.,1
The first one I received of this was near dry.  I returned it for a replacement.  The second is near dry as well.  It seems as though the ink pad should be stored in a resealable plastic bag to keep the ink from drying out - and be delivered that way.  But I think that the manufacturer is just being cheap and putting  barely any ink on the pad.,1
Pad came uninked and did not work well even after adding Carter's Neat-Flo red ink.  The pad is too coarse and you end up with a terrible imprint (parts of imprint missing).  We compared this to an existing inkpad (finer texture) to see the difference.  I'm very disappointed and do not recommend.,1
arrived dried out. i didn't get even one good stamp out of it.,1
"I don't know if it was the supplier's packaging or if it's standard with this type of ink pad, but there was spilled ink all over the pad.",1
"First of all this thing is massive.  Second of all, it looks nothing like the picture.  The picture looks almost like the handle is made of wood.  It's all a beautiful rosewood color with lovely staining... this monstrosity arrived and it's ugly, giant plastic, and does not look too well made, and for the price I was really shocked.",1
Says it cuts up to 10 sheets well you better have some brawn to do it. I ended up cutting down to 4 sheets and the blasted thing gets stuck. I generally do get out of sorts as i did make the purchase. I will go professional shortly. Found out thru laser measurement that the blasted thing is out of alignment of 3/16ths of an inch just enough to make pages or paper cut nonuniform. Beings the paper i need to cut needed to be precise it was a no go. The reason it gets stuck is because its out of alignment that's why i borrowed a laser measurement machine to test it. For the price i paid i guess you get what you paid for. I have tried every device i know to make the uniformity stable. I am out of ideas. I even tried to use a square with no success the numbers in a straight line do not align at all. The blade also get stuck even with 4 sheets of standard printer paper. I would steer clear if your looking for professional cutting.,1
"The mesh wass dented where the ""Rolodex"" was imprinted and glued on.  Not high quality. Returned it.",1
"The ""rolodex"" insignia was poorly glued on at a non level angle and bent the mesh.  I returned this.",1
"What a shame, something so simple, but hey, we can pull another penny per box in profit...now these are crap.  :-(",1
What does it NOT do? CUT PAPER!! THis is a total waste of money. Don't buy. I can't even cut one single paper for the full length without it tearing. TERRIBLE.,1
"I was looking for a rubber band to hold my ceramic molds together. I needed it to be 6""-7"" so it would fit tightly around most of my molds. The first thing I noticed was how hard it was to open the box. I should have left it closed. When I got it open, all the bands were stuck to each other and tangled up. It took a very long time to separate them. Then I went to put it on the mold and found out that even though they are 5/8"" wide, the stretch on them is twice the size of the band. If you need something to keep the kids entertained, this would be a great project: ""Hey kids, come on over and help me separate these"". Then walk away and let the kids get the job done.",1
"After a few uses, doesn't cut regular paper. Paper just slides between the edge and the blade uncut. Waste of money.",1
"wow, I wish these lived up to all the good reviews. maybe I got an old/bad batch?! 2 out of 3 break easily when trying to wrap them around something. they have very little elasticity, reminding me of really old rubber bands you dig out of the back of a drawer that seem gummy and brittle at the same time. wish I'd returned them before breaking several dozen trying to wrap up some various computer cables. oh well, next time I'll buy them in a store so I can check them out first!!",1
"The description indicates these are 3.5"", but they are actually 4.5"".  They do not work for my needs.  Quality seems good though.",1
"enormous, bulky, returned it",2
large an expensive.  rent instead,2
"When we first got this easel, I really liked it! It was so compact and easy to move around, which is a relief when you live in a small home filled to the brim with kids toys! As opposed to most large easels that require large amounts of floor space even when not in use, I really loved that this one could be folded up into a small size and stored away in an instant. However... within 3 months of receiving it, this product was literally falling apart at the seams. Now normally when a baby toy falls apart after a few months of use, I think ""well, yes, that's why I buy inexpensive toys - kids break them, duh!"" - except, my son was only 9 months old when this broke beyond repair, and had never physically manipulated this product at all! The only us this easel had gotten was from me taking it out about once a week and showing him some magnets while he gazed at it with interest before we fairly quickly moved on to the next activity, at which point I'd fold it up as directed and put it away until next week. Yet every time I folded up and unfolded this easel I noticed the seams were becoming flimsier and flimsier, the boards were seemingly tearing apart... but I still never expected to open it up one afternoon just to see one board finally break free and fall to the ground! All of this from an adult gently using this product for a few minutes, once a week? Yeah, in that case it was pretty disappointing!

I must add that I love leaving reviews here as reading others' reviews helps me so much and I try to give back the same way. And maybe I'm just a really positive person in general, or perhaps I've just had good luck, but the fact remains that I virtually NEVER leave negative reviews for products, ever. I've written hundreds  of reviews here on Amazon and am quite sure this is only the 5th product, if that, that I've given less than 3 stars. I still can't bring myself to give it only 1 star as it WASN'T expensive, so I don't expect that much by way of quality and am not  exactly HORRIFIED that it fell apart, but I am certainly surprised that a few months of occasionally opening up, briefly using, and then properly storing away this little easel was enough to just... destroy it. Bizarre! And since I only owned one of these, I didn't try buying a second, I can't say with certainty that mine wasn't a rare defective one as there are certainly plenty of positive reviews on here... but I still wanted to share my experience because I know that many times people leave reviews after just receiving a product, or certainly within a few weeks of using it, and may not update those reviews later on. So perhaps if more reviews were left after several months of owning and using the product, there would be more experiences like mine... all I know for sure is that I try to be very reasonable with my expectations, and nothing short of a piece completely falling apart after gentle use would cause me to leave a negative review, so to anyone who's looking for an easel that will last them a long time, this may not be the one for you! However, if you just need this for a short period of time and don't want to shell out a fortune for it than this might meed your needs just fine. I do hope this review helps others make an informed choice! - Amy",2
very small!,2
Too small,2
"It was very pretty but very, very tiny. You can't write much in it...",2
good,2
"First of all, this appears to be the exact same map as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rand-McNally-U-S-A-Wall-Map/dp/0528002279/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rand McNally U.S.A Wall Map</a>.  However, the linked map is only $5.95 (and still available for free shipping with prime).  It's pretty infuriating when Amazon lists two identical products, shipped from the same place (Amazon), at very different prices.

My biggest gripe, however, is this: I searched ""US Road Map"" to find this map.  I need a map to hang on the wall and trace routes with pins and strings.  The roads on this map are extremely faint... almost the same color as the background.  Seriously.  You can BARELY see the roads.

After receiving this sub par map, I have since re-searched and hope that the Michelin map (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michelin-Map-USA-Political-14761-p-Rolled-Maps-Wall-Michelin/dp/2061011306/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michelin Map USA Political  14761  (p, Rolled) (Maps/Wall (Michelin))</a>) or perhaps the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/United-States-Executive-Wall-Map-tubed/dp/0792293207/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">United States Executive Wall Map (tubed)</a>&nbsp;will have better representation of US roads and highways.

Since it's not really cost effective to return the map (shipping is more than the ten dollar purchase price), I would burn the map in frustration, but it is lightly coated in plastic --not thick enough to prevent creases and wrinkles, but thick enough to create toxic smoke.

=========Further complaints about Amazon (so not necessarily complaints about the product)

On top of this, the map was shipped in a HUGE rectangular box.  Again and again amazon customers complain about Amazon's horrible packing methods... yet they continue to do this!  Not only THAT, but I also ordered two boxes of tacks at the exact same time.  ALL THREE arrived in separate (HUGE) boxes!!!",2
Clicked the wrong star on the last review...this is a good map!  Good size and the price is right.  Good enough for erasable markers.,2
"It gets the job done but is thin and flimsy. Like most I've found it isn't a very good quality. I've recently found some that are teacher created pocket charts here on Amazon that even come in colors and designed cute that will eventually replace all of my pocket charts but for now this will have to do. I recommend you spend the extra $10 and purchase those to begin with but if your tight on money this one is ok. The blue part is as thin as paper. It crinkles every time you touch it. If you bump into it the cards get all messed up or worse start falling out. The clear slots are thin. I wanted this to use for sight words instead of making a word wall this year but I can only add about 4 3x5 cards before the clear part starts sagging and hanging open. It's a big pocket chart which is the reason I purchased it but if I can't use the entire thing because it will not hold more than a few cards then the size is of no benefit. So, it's just usable enough to keep from trashing it but I recommend finding a stronger, more durable pocket chart.",2
"You only get the cards, which I didn't realize when I purchased it. But on top of the fact that your only paying for the cards they don't even come perforated... All around I wouldn't order this product.",2
"I didn't read the reviews, I was shopping for something specific (the pocket chart) and ended up with nothing but calendar date numbers that I have to cut apart myself. :(

I gave 2 stars for the quality of the numbers and the fact that you get 3 sets in different colors.

I deducted one for the price for what you get, deducted one for misleading listing and deducted one for the fact that you have to cut them apart yourself.

Don't waste your money. I'll keep them as our pocket calendar numbers are getting kinda ragged and it'd not be worth it to send them back...but it was not what I expected according to the listing.",2
you only get the cards.,2
"I was surprised when I received these - if I had just seen them in a store on the shelf, I would have never paid so much for them.  This buy was a real mistake for the price.  The variety of cards is good, but a few of the images are not to my taste and will go unused.",2
Has fallen apart after 2 months of use but with the mission of this company who can be really mad at them?,2
"Out of the 100 postcards, there are about 15-20 that I'm actually interested in. Many of them are just boring. Not as good as I had hoped.",2
"My professor made us buy one of these and I don't believe it was worth it.  It has very limited functionality and, for the price, I don't think it adds much to the classroom experience.

Perhaps there's a teacher out there who has found a cunning use for this guy, but I'm hard pressed to believe that since it can do so little.  I think it's a sham to ask students to shell out for one of these on top of books and everything else we have to get for school.

I'm not giving it one star because, as a product, it does actually excel at its task.  I was able to answer the multiple choice quizzes we had in lecture.  My low rating is more because of its few capabilities and limited application in the classroom.",2
"Make sure you use the right batteries ( Energizer). The duracells are just a tad bit short.
Would like to have seen Manufacturer make the distinction so at least one knows before they toss it.",2
"Very nice looking, but cheap quality and depth is NOT same as most others. Will only hold half recipe cards of other types.",2
"I have been buying the Peanuts calendar for well over ten years, it brings joy to every day. This year however, I noticed that they removed all the Sunday comics, thereby reducing the calendar from 365 days to 313 days, obviously saving them money as they charge the same amount for a cheaper product. I wish that I had an alternative, it is so frustrating when companies think they can make more money by doing something like this. Shame on the publisher and manufacturer.",2
"I love Dilbert!  But just like the Peanuts calendar this same publisher has removed 52 days of Sunday comics to reduce the calendar to 313 days for the same price as 365 last year. Shame on them, I wish that I had an alternative to buy the real 365 day version. And shame on Scott Adams for selling out to these guys.",2
i tried using this and found it too busy.  looking for something more streamlined and simple to organize myself.  this planner almost defeats its own purpose because it is complicated and time consuming.  also very overpriced.,2
"I was looking forward to using this tool as a guide to kick start my college semester and work. Just like the book, it's too confusing and jumbled to know what to do. Mainly only talks about her life and not much on helping the customer.",2
"While this planner had some great ideas embodying the ""7-Minute Life"" planning concepts, and I did benefit a little from starting these pages, I just could not keep filling out a planner by hand.

It is impractical and difficult to use a planner that requires you to fill in every day/date, copy tasks and goals over and over again (this reminds me of the Franklin-Covey system, a bit). And then start all over again in three months!  It may be the breakthrough that some users need, but to me it was a tedious use of time; more restrictive than freeing.

I gave this to a friend who was very interested in the system, and returned to a favorite paper-based system, backed up by my iPhone.",2
Great little notebook and just the size I wanted.,2

This was an encouragement to read item for my 7 year old BOY. The red is not red in fact it's a hot pink. Needless to say he is very disappointed today. The concept itself is a good one but I don't think it will be long before it's broken.,2
One of the two we purchsed didn't even work.,2
concept is great...we have another one from another vendor. but this one came with the battery not working and no matter what new battery i put in it...it will not work!,2
Too detailed and surface area to really color effectively.,2
this book is very small and the pages are very flimsy .the cover is hard though .,2
"Good collection of colors, however the scent is fading on most of them. Only a few actually smell ""yummy"" Hahaha.

Also, the gel bleeds on some. Not great quality, I recommend ""GEL BEE"" glitter pens over these.",2
"The ink skipped too much for it to be usable. I tried every pen in the pack to check if it was just 1 dud pen. Unfortunately not, so I ended up returning it. I don't recall the pens having distinguishable smells. They smelled pleasant to me in general though.",2
They don't have a scent and the ink didn't come out very well.,2
"These pens are a cute idea; however,  I do not notice the scent and I do not notice the yellow ink when writing it is very hard to see. These pens also didn't take any time at all to leak. I would not purchase them agian.",2
"Smells good, but NOT pastel.. They are neon & very bright neon colors.. I been looking for true pastel.. These are not it!!!",2
"Flows easily but gloppy, resulting in too much product. Colors are soft, bordering on dull, which was a surprise because at first I thought they were almost neon.",2
I ordered three of these calendars. Have been buying them for years. This year one of them had the first 6 days missing! I don't know how hard quality control is but it was embarrassing as I gave this as a gift to someone in Italy and it is kind of hard to return it from there!  We will have to scan the first six days from our calendar. I hope that this never happens again.,2
"Wayy too cheesy.  Every year we order a new calendar for the office as a little perk up each morning.  The jokes are roughly in the realm of dad jokes, if not worse.  ""The Colby Cheese says he's very fondue of you""

"These are very flimsy file folders - not the same quality as typical manilla file folders that you get from an office supply store. They are very cute, and it's nice to have something different and distinctive in my files, but I don't think they'll last long. If you need durability, look elsewhere.",2
"It has no tabs, so therefore it is useless to me.  Looks nice though for a book, not an address book--as such I would be eternally hunting and folding pages over.  I foresee this becoming a big mess quickly.",2
"From the photos I expected different but still functional clips in an easy to get at container. The container ITSELF is good, but the circular paper clips are lacking. It takes a bit more dexterity (or repetition) to use them as you would a standard paper clip, and even then it frequently takes a moment or two to just get ONE clip out of the container and ready to use.",2
"I am very annoyed about this purchase.  These sticky notes are so cute and look very fun to use.  But they don't peel off well.  Instead they wrinkle.  And then, the adhesive isn't sticky enough to actually stick them any where.

Very annoying.",2
"Should have looked closer prior to buying.  Colors are blah, content is not particularly amusing or interesting to me.  I planned to use it on my kitchen wall, but it just wasn't the bright spot I had hoped it would be.

I tossed it after I got a replacement with pretty photos on it.",2
Quality of the paper used is disappointing. Doesn't seem like it will last very long as a color reference for a print shop.,2
"The binding immediately started falling apart - no big deal, I taped it back together with packing tape.  The bigger issue for me is that I like writing with Uniball Vision pens, and they bleed through this paper so badly it makes marks on the next page.  Too bad - if these notebooks were more durable I'd be really into them.",2
I love these book marks I usually buy them at barns and noble but they seem to be B-stock or something because they are peeling and the coloring is coming off. So I would not buy them online again.,2
"not very good, so large",2
Very basic quality.  The tassel is the nicest part.  It's worth a $1 or $2...,2
"not very good, so large",2
I was hoping I could finally stop looking for a small address book that had enough room to be able to write normally.  I thought I did but when I started to fill out there wasn't enough space to print.  I couldn't even read what I tried to print. It's a darling book but just now practical for me.  Can't return as I tried to write in it.,2
Well this was damaged had a huge fold in it. A mystery how it happened because it was only shipped with 4 other book marks in a cardboard box folder. Have no idea how that could have happened inside the box unless damaged before being placed in the box. Any way not worth sending back so I cut the bottom 1/2 off where the fold was so I have a gold sun bookmark with a tassle on it that has 1/2 a saying on it. Hey it works.,2
It's size is small and  the space is not quite enough in writing a contact details,2
Not what I thought it would be.  Should've read the description better.,2
It was bigger than expected. Takes up a lot of space on the fridge.,2
smaller than expected,2
No magnet on the back .. .BOO.  I mean where do I put this baby. . these kinds of notebooks need magnets to stick on the fridge.  Super disappointed.  Now this sucker is collecting dust in a drawer.,2
Disappointed as it was smaller than I thought.,2
The adhesive is inadequate. Won't stay stuck on even regular paper. I brought them into the office and donated them to the supply cabinet for others. Disappointed.,2
I have bought other books in this group that I liked much better,2
It's the size of my palm and my hand is small....Very disappointing! I can't give my mom this for Christmas. It's pitiful,2
"Seems like the copied over questions from a girlfriend/boyfriend book.  Some of the questions they had you answer were just weird and uncomfortable for something you would give your Mom.  The book was so small also, fits in the palm of your hand-was unflattering. It also took so long to get that even though I ordered it weeks before Mother's Day I still didn't receive it until afterwards.",2
This was much more confusing for my students than I though \t it would be.  I was hoping it would help teach them sentence structure but instead you must really be able to already make sentences no problem to be able to use this correctly without an adult telling the child each and every piece.  Maybe once my students get the hang of sentences then they will find this interesting.  For now they just keep adding pieces to one another creating a mess.,2
This had a weird shape to it. I don't like that it isn't hang-able or stand-able like the picture suggests.,2
"These dishes look really cute in my kitchen and the product reviews were pretty favorable - as long as you happened to receive the sets made in the USA and not China.  I purchased two dish sets and some accessory pieces and - because of the rather steep price - assumed they were American made.  Wrong.  Sadly, several of the dishes chipped when first washed in the dishwasher and more dishes chipped from use in the microwave - clearly these are not dishwasher and microwave safe. Extremely poor quality - don't be fooled by the high price!",2
"These may be fine hangers but they are not what I expected. The exterior edge is sharp, rather than rounded as I thought it would be, like the others I've seen. I will use these but wish I had found something rounder so as to leave less imprint on clothing. As well, they are very flexible, seems they are good only for light things.

 I'll keep looking.",2
Smaller than expected.,2
"I homeschool my grandson. I ordered this because of high reviews on this program for kids with sensory issues, but I don't like it. The style is not attractive, and it was not easier for him to master. After trying this for a year, I have switched to something else that. I sometimes pull this out for the content and produce worksheet so that the writing can be done in the style I prefer. In fairness, there are many homeschool parents that love this and feel it works well for their child. I think people should always choose what works in their own situation when it comes to books for teaching. Children are different, and this may be perfect for your child.  I have no problem with the way the material is presented, just with the boxy, hard to read cursive style.",2
"These are awesome tabs for your bible,  but my pack had several missing tabs.",2
"Wish I hadn't added them to my Bible.  Difficult to get on, and the pages were too delicate for them.",2

To flimsy.,2
"It's made out of a very thin, low quality material. I expected it to be made out of the same durable material as any other pocket chart, but it's not.",2
tiny - cheap - and the box is ridiculous!,2
"Have these since Xmas and they still disappoint.

The box the stencils come in is fine as is the material the stencils are cut from.

The problems:
Each category has stencils in all different directions.
The items are not appealing or identifiable.
The items to stencil are small.
Cannot fill in with crayon, do a dot etc. Have to use something with a finer point to outline. The result is still not appealing.

Again and again, they are taken out.  Frustrating and no interest here.",2
"This is a nice, convenient little planner, in a convenient size, and nicely formatted for flexible use.  However, it is quite costly for what you get. Sadly, after buying this for my 18yo son, we were browsing in the dollar store, and he found a similarly formatted planner, of comparable quality, and slightly larger in size, that he liked better (a bit more flexible for planning and a bit more room to write), so this one was abandoned.  I felt it was a waste of $13. I have since been using it as an expense tracker--but again, I could have gotten this at the dollar store! I don't have many expenses as a stay-at-home mama--just once or twice a week to a grocery store, a handful of online purchases, and another errand or two every couple weeks. And that is enough information to fill up this little book!

I like the blank pages on the right hand side of each open spread. Great for notes! But that is the same format we found in the dollar planner, too!  I also like the elastic closure that holds this shut in a neat, tidy little book.  The dollar version does not have this.

This is certainly a nice little planner, but my recommendation would have to be: Go to the dollar store.",2
"if you write microscopically, have tiny hands, and really have a small list of things that you can already memorize, then get this... it's so tiny. i should have read the dimensions more carefully, but still.. ""extra small"" should be ""super extra tiny."" so expensive for what it is. would not buy again.",2
For years I wondered what the hype was about Moleskine so I finally ordered their larger book. It's awful! The paper warps so bad and I bought a watercolor book. I had to tape the pages down by wrapping it ove to the hard cover and still the warping was so bad that color would run off humps and into valleys so that I had no control. I went back to Pentalic's Aqua Journal and will never buy anything else again. This is just awful and way over privpced for what I received. Yuck.,2
"seriously, they should call this thing a baby notebook meant for babies...

Its tiny",2
Cheap looking. I wanted a high-quality look when taking notes in front of a client. These soft covers were not it. Spend a little more for the hard cover versions.,2
"I thought this was the extra large size. They are good for desks and nightstands and jotting down lists or notes, but not big enough to comfortably journal in in my opinion.",2
"If you get a good copy, this is a great notebook, but there seems to be a lot of sample variation here. I've bought four of these. Of them, two have been good, the other two exhibit large levels of feathering with fountain pens. I've tried the same pen with the same ink on two of these, one feathers always, one doesn't. I've tried different pens and different inks and it's consistent.",2
"I love my moleskin notebook, and bought this pencil as a supplement, but was disappointed with this for the price.  I didn't read reviews just added to my cart, but as others have pointed out, no eraser for a 15 dollar pencil?  Also, I have the professional moleskin, and it doesn't lay flat against the notebook, it sticks out.  I would recommend the zebra M-301 click pencils, cheaper, and works really well with this notebook, plus can attach to notebook, comes with 3 leads, and an eraser.",2
I purchased the wrong size.  It's a great little book; just not my size.  My mistake.  Other than that the product is good.,2
"I've used these notebooks for years, but the quality of the paper seems to have gone down. I take notes with a fountain pen, and on this notebook, my writing goes through the paper.  The paper doesn't seem to be as heavy as in the past.  By contrast the paper in the Pantone notebooks accomodates fountain pen use.",2
"It allmost made it to using all the pages (one side) and then it started disintigrating, and it went very quickly once it started.  Survived like 2 months total.",2
"Nice journal , but over priced and over hyped. You'd do much better with Lemome notebooks. Better quality all around, and less expensive.",2
"I have used three separate Moleskine journals for light daily use.  I typically jot notes to myself, including shopping lists, phone numbers, and other items.  They are stored in my pocket or on a nightstand.  In spite of light use, each of these journals has suffered from a split in the binding from the cover to the pages themselves.  For the price you pay for these jorunals, they should last longer than a few months of light use.  To be fair, I've not had much luck with other similar journals of the same size, although they have been three or four dollars cheaper.  I'd love to see one of these with a more flexible and durable cover and binding.",2
"I have consumed more than half a dozen of these Moleskine pocket hardcover notebooks over the past few years.  Overall I'm quite disappointed in their long-term performance, especially for the price and all the marketing hype.  I guess that's what these come down to - pure hype.  They tout names of famous writers like Hemingway and Chatwin almost as if they actually used their products.  I know for a fact that Ernest Hemingway died before the Moleskine Srl *brand* of notebooks came into being.  Sure, the old writers used to use ""moleskine"" or leather-bound notebooks, but they were handmade and undoubtedly of better quality.  These aren't even leather bound; they are bound with some kind of plastic simulated leather.

The paper is of decent quality, but bleeds through pretty easily and frays at the edges.

But the most irritating thing about the Moleskine Srl notebooks is the fact that the binding is as fragile as eggshells.  Every single one of the notebooks I've been through has required reinforcement by tape and/or glue before 1/3 of the pages had been written on.  They just cannot handle day-to-day repetitive use.  The threads come apart, the pages work loose from the threads, and the faux leather binding cracks at the ""hinge"" area.  Eventually the strip of paper in the spine that's holding together the mini booklets of paper inside eventually rips and the binding just falls apart from within.

I suppose the only reason I've used so many of them was because I just wanted to a good notebook and they sure *seem* like they'd be good when you pick one up in the store.  Like Mulder on the X-Files, I really wanted to believe in Moleskine.  And I wanted to give the product an honest chance before giving up on it.  But now I'm convinced they are not worthy of my good notes.  Maybe I'll use the ones I still have for mundane stuff like shopping lists or something.  They COULD be a good notebook if Moleskine could just build a durable binding.

For now, for my ""good notes"" that are worth keeping, I'm switching over to the Leuchtturm 1917 pocket notebooks.  I'll go through a few of those and then write a review on them.  So far, they seem much more promising even though the Leuchtturms have more of a ""perfect"" type binding and the pages do not lay flat like on the Moleskine.  I can live with that, though.",2

I have used Moleskines for years. I love the feel of paper and take note extensively.  I used an iPad for a while but went back to my moleskine  I will order more. But...the binding on this notebook is coming apart and I am about half way through. There might be 50 Moleskins in the storage box but this my first defect. I hope they have not compromised their manufacturing.,2
Ink easily bleeds through paper- wouldn't expect that for the price.,2
"Evernote is a wonderful company and I use it almost everyday on my cellphone, tablet and laptop. The 3 free months of the premium version makes this notebook one fo the most inexpensive in the entire Moleskine line. However the problem that I have with this and all other hard cover moleskine notebooks is that the quality is not good at all. The paper has detached from the backing on every single one that I've had. Moleskine does a good job marketing and has a cult following but it hasn't stood the test of time. The softcover notebooks by moleskine are great but there is no evernote version in softcover. So at the writing of this review it's just under $21 dollars, if you factor in the 3 free months of Evernote premium that comes with it that would take the price down to $6. If you're willing to take the chance it's not a bad deal but with the possibility of it falling apart half way through it's life cycle I've personally decided to go with the Leuchtturm 1917 Notebook instead. It's much higher quality, has index pages, archival stickers and heavier paper that is string bound rather than glued in.",2
"This is the first Moleskin notebook I've purchased. Frankly I bought it because Staples had it mismarked so with the 3 months of Evernote Premium it came out to a screaming deal. I thought these were supposed to be premium books.  Honestly I don't see it. The paper is thin, and I get ink bleed through from my Mont Blanc rollerball.

Moleskin seems to have done a great marketing job, but that's about it.  Unless you're a EV premium user and get a good deal on the book, there's no way it's worth the price they put on it.  There's no reason to buy this over a generic office supply store book.",2
Bought this pen to match with my Moleskine notebook. From the picture the pen seemed to have a low profile design which it does not. The pen is not worth the money. I would suggest if you are considering purchasing this pen to consider going to Staples and purchasing an adhesive pen loop for notebooks for $1.99 and using any pen or pencil you want.,2
"Poor product and overpriced. I bought the pen as a companion for my moleskin.

The only bright side is that the pen has a flat edge which ostensibly would mesh well with the notebook, not rolling, etc.

The downside is that the pen was unreliable. Started and stopped, then suddenly was out of ink entirely without even fading. Did it dry out? Who knows.

The housing of the pen is cheap plastic and the end of the pen slides around, begging to be played with, which will lead to it being unscrewed.

Once it dried up , I was penless during the day which was a hassle. The stationary store I visited, in order to replace it quickly, told me that they had had nothing but complaints about the pen since they'd received it. Go figure.

I bought a metal Zebra pen from Amazon and have been far happier.",2
"This is a cool pen that makes a bit of a statement (a really tiny bit of a statement, though) like my Moleskine grid notebook.  If you are like me, however, and plan on using it daily, it simply isn't worth your money because you will deplete this pen of ink too quickly.  Instead, write in your Moleskine with a Papermate Flair (http://www.amazon.com/Papermate-Point-Guard-Porous-Medium/dp/B0006VO194/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1394121715&sr=8-3&keywords=papermate+flair) - I use black but they come in many colors for those who need that.",2
"I've been using moleskine products for years, but this was my first set of the cahier journals. If you are expecting a thinner version with a cardboard cover that has the same quality as the Classic, DON'T!!!

The paper quality is more like a mixture between normal notebook paper and construction paper. This is NOT what I was expecting. I expected slightly lower quality materials for everyday use, not thin construction paper.",2
I feel like I bought someone's used set of notebooks from a garage sale. Each of the three notebooks is a little (or more than a little) crumpled up. All three notebooks have bent/wrinkled covers and pages throughout. Pretty much a waste.,2
"I really like the Moleskine brand, but this pen just doesn't stand up to the same quality. The ink smears a bit and while I like how the pen fits in the notebooks, it just isn't comfortable for long durations. If you want something that fits great in your notebook, this does that but if you have much writing to do, I can't recommend it.",2
"I normally love all things Moleskine but this pen is just disappointing.  I would have expected a pen of this quality to be about 1/4 the price that I paid for it, and I won't be wasting money on it again.",2
"Seemed cool when I bought it, but I never use it.  It's also plastic, so I'm wary of throwing it in my pocket or stuffing it somewhere in briefcase where it could break.

Seems to work fine.  Has very slim clip, so might be good for people who want to clip it onto the notebook they keep.  This is the reason for it's design.  It sits flatter than another pen.",2
"Too skinny, no pocket. My fault, I didn't order the right one. There are like a million to choose from. :)",2
"Moleskines are oft regarded as THE classic premium notebook. The cover is soft, velvety almost, and the pages a pleasing muted ivory color. They come in many different varieties. They have a huge cult following of people, many who are amazing artists, more who just enjoy writing their thoughts or stories down for personal enjoyment. There are websites devoted to modifications and everyday uses for them. In short, when someone cares about what they're writing, they'll often write it in a Moleskine.

So why only two stars?

It has nothing to do with the Amazon's shipping times--which shouldn't be mentioned in product reviews at all--or a need to troll people for liking them so much. If the notebook works for you and you love it, that's awesome. And I used to be one of those people. My Moleskine in filled with story notes, front to back.

But the allure faded when I ventured back into a hobby I'd strayed from several years back, before I'd discovered Moleskines. When I began collecting fountain pens again and amassing huge stockpiles of inks of all different types I discovered these notebooks' Achilles' heel.

But let's review some facts about them first:

- The notebooks are manufactured by a company based in Milan, Italy. They are an Italian company through and through.
- The notebooks are designed in Italy.
- The notebooks have acid-free paper.
- The notebooks are NOT manufactured in Italy, but rather in China (with a small number of notebook models being made in Turkey or Vietnam).
- The quality control of the notebook ""hardware"" (cover, bands, bookmark) is great.
- The quality control of the actual paper is woefully lacking,

And that's where my problem with the notebooks lies.

The paper in these notebooks is thin; prone to severe feathering, show through, and bleed through; and does not provide for much in the way of ink shading.

Does this matter id you're using a ballpoint? Mostly no, though show through is bad with all types of ink. But even though ballpoint ink isn't absorbed into the paper, the pages are so thin that you can see right through them.

Does this matter if you use rollerballs, gels, or--as is the case with my main use--fountain pens? Absolutely.

While the problems vary from ink to ink, feathering and bleed through with these notebooks is atrocious. If you're using anything but the finest nib and the driest ink you won't be able to use the backs of the pages on which you're writing. And if you're a fan of inks that shade heavily, forget about it. The paper is far too absorbent to let any shading happen.

The only inks I haven't had a problem with are very light ballpoint refills (specifically the turquoise Fisher Space Pen refills). They're light enough to not show through, and because they're ballpoints the ink isn't absorbed into the paper.

If you want some actual quality European paper in almost the exact same notebook form (and I mean almost exactly the same), get a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rhodia-Orange-Webnotebook-5-5x8-25-Lined/dp/B0029FE1J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rhodia Orange Webnotebook 5.5x8.25 Lined</a>. Rhodia paper is some of the best in the world (they're owned by Clairefontaine, whose paper is to die for). With the Rhodia paper you will not experience bleed through. You will not experience show through. You will be able to see the inks' shading characteristics. And even the wettest blob of an inky line you can lay down will not feather. Yes, the Webnotebooks are twice the price, but they are one hundred percent absolutely worth it if what you're after is actual quality, not a fad.

However, if you write with ballpoints or pencil and not with anything that lays down a wet line, the Moleskines won't do you wrong.",2
"There's a lot of good to be said about the notebook, and Moleskine deserve credit for reviving this design which had nearly disappeared.  The hard cover. . . the elastic band. . .  the cloth bookmark. . .  the ivory paper. . .  the rounded corners. . .  It's all good.  I might quibble that the ruled lines are spaced a bit narrowly for my handwriting.  It's good with a EF nib pen, and it fits a few more lines on each page, but it's a wee bit cramped compared with my normal handwriting.

What really ruins it for me is the paper quality.  I've heard it varies from one batch to the next, and it sure seems like I got one of the bad ones.  I found many combinations of fountain pens and ink are prone to ugly feathering and bleeding in it.  With many of them it's impractical to write on both sides of the sheet, which basically cuts the notebook in half from what it should be.  TO BE FAIR, I found I could tame it by choosing the right ink (Noodlers Black) and using a not-too-wet fountain pen.  Indeed, I would be willing to take this extra effort to adapt to this notebook's quirks if there were no better alternatives out there.

Recently, though, other companies such as Quo Vadis and Rhodia have come up with their own moleskine-style notebooks featuring high-quality paper.  They cost a bit more, but I figure this type of notebook is a premium product to begin with.  In the future I'll give Moleskine a miss and spend a little more for a better notebook.  (Being able to write with confidence on both sides of the page means I could actually come out ahead on cost too.)",2
"This is not a bad pocket journal, and it has very good paper quality, suitable for use with good fountain pens.  However, it is marketed as doing something very specific with Evernote: allowing handwriting recognition and seamless integration of notes written in this product with other device-generated notes.  In this, it is little better than any other small notebook costing a quarter as much.  Being a small, tightly bound book, the pages do not lay flat for photographing with the device's camera, which is the means of importing into Evernote.  You must use some weight or other method for getting in-focus pictures of your pages.  This interferes with the auto-cropping and distortion-correcting function in Evernote.  Furthermore, I have been unable to detect any enhanced recognition ability referable to the use of this notebook.  The little tag stickers only work most, but not all of the time, and the page-defining ribbon does not lay flat or straight either.
Evernote's handwriting OCR is fair to middling, and the important fact here is that it is no better with this expensive little notebook than it is with a $2.50 Clairfontaine pocket notebook of the same size with equally good paper.  Evernote should modify its software to recognize the little Tag stickers wherever they are applied, and just sell them by themselves.  I would not buy another of these pocket notebooks.",2
PRINT QUALITY INTENSITY IS TERRIBLE!! EVEN WITH GLASSES ON -- VERY HARD TO READ.  IF NOT FOR THAT THIS COULD BE A 5 STAR ITEM.,2
The ink bleeds through to the other side. I was hoping for better quality paper.,2
"I used to be a die-hard fan of the Moleskine diary, but I haven't purchased anything other than a package of cahiers since I started bullet journaling. This was my first Moleskine classic in a handful of years, and I think they must have changed something. The paper has a slight shine to it, and it takes a moment for anything other than a ballpoint pen to soak into the paper, which means you get a ton of streaks and splotchy ink marks if you aren't extremely careful. I can't imagine how bad it would be for lefties.

There isn't a ton of feathering, but I can see the ghosting from two pages back using an InkJoy Gel pen, which seems pretty ridiculous. Forget using a Tombow brush pen or a Crayola marker in this thing. The color is a sort of nauseating pink, instead of the more orchid-y purple depicted on the item page.

I saw the bad reviews and decided to buy this anyway, so it's on me. I'm definitely disappointed, but it'll have to do for now.",2
"I'm a big fan of Moleskin products, in general, and so my first impression was ""Where was this when I was working on my PhD a few years ago?"" However, on further examination, I realized the product was lackluster. Here's why:

1. Assumptions. Moleskin's designers assume the user wants to organize what she reads in alphabetical order and predetermines a set amount of pages for each letter. This is useless. Both scholars and general book lovers have favorite authors that will likely fill more than the allotted pages, while other sections go unused. In addition, this ""feature"" eliminates many other ways or organizing your reviews (e.g., year read, year written, genre, etc.).

2. Gimmickry. Rather than provide us with a bunch of silly stickers with symbols and exclamations, how about making the books more flexible by including blank, color-coded stickers that we can self label to organize our books? The provided stickets just ratchet up the cost of production with little value added.

3. Page Layout. Here again Moleskin was heavy-handed in dictating how we should use the product and organize our information. In my opinion it privileges bibliographic information over note taking. If I'm going to haul a book around that's the size of a paperback, I want it to be for notes, not a list I can easily keep on my computer or smart phone. I carry paper for its flexibility. Let it be flexible.

The product isn't all bad, of course. This is Moleskin, so the journal is of very high production quality (e.g., great paper, nice binding, ribbon dividers, etc.). I just wish Moleskin would have scaled back the features by about 80% to make the book more flexible. I'd love the top 1/4 of the page given over to bibliographic data, the remaining 3/4s for notes, and flexible divider tabs that can be attached anywhere in the book with blank stickers for labeling them.",2
"This journal looks great -- black cover with authors names and titles on it in a range of language, a fabric covered rubber band to hold it closed, tabs with letters to organize the entries please an index you can create, and tri colored ribbons to mark your place in the journal.  It even includes a bookmarker in case you need one.

I have several journals that I use to review products and services including two movie journals and a wine tasting journal.  I find them useful when I'm trying to decide what to see again or for the first time or when picking out a new bottle versus an old favorite for a meal.  I'm a book reviewer, been one for years before Amazon Vine program, so I review easily 150 books a year.

This journal could not handle even one year of what I review in it's pages.  That is the biggest problem I have with it.

Each letter of the alphabet has entry that includes areas for you to fill in date read, title, author, awards, your impressions and a rating among other information.  However there are only 6 pages per letter.  You have to do decide how to organize the books, by title or by author but really I doubt I'll be reading as many X books as ones that begin with H or C or S for example.  There are many empty pages in the back so the journal could easily have added more pages to either all of lettered sections or to the most commonly used letters.

With half the book unstructured I really feel disappointed by the layout.  The unstructured sections aren't make it less organized and throw the idea of the index out the window.  Do I include more notes on the books in those ""personally tabbed"" or ""blank"" sections?  The structured section is great, I just need more of it and less of these empty pages.

The publisher needs to rethink this design and rework it.  When then do that, it might be a book worth having.  For now, it's only a book you'll need to seriously stop and think ""Is this book worthy of inclusion in this pages?"" or you'll soon run out of room.",2
"For me this product really misses the mark.  The book looks like an old fashioned address book with lettered tabs.  For each letter of the alphabet, there is room to review 6 books.  So you may review only six books that start with the letter T and just as many (six) books that start with the letter X -- does that make much sense?  Each page contains an area to list the following information: title, date read, author, nationality, first edition, publisher, year, quotes, original language, awards, notes, opinion and rating.  The sections for quotes and opinion are the largest but still too small for me to really fill in as much as I would like.  There is no way to add pages in any section as this is a bound book.  The book is the size of a standard paperback novel -- so just not large enough to write anything of substance.  If this product were an application for my Blackberry or an iphone, I think I would love it.  I'd have a list with me that would remind me of authors I liked anytime I walked into a book store. I'd have more space and the option to review as many items under each letter of the alphabet as I liked and I could include books that I would like to read or received as recommendations from others.  The quality of the product for the price is fine, but I couldn't recommend it.",2
Very small.,2
"WARNING: This is the Moleskin with the folded/stitched binding, NOT the perfect binding. It is not terrible, but it is not what I wanted. Sad face. Now I have to live with my unfortunate decision for like... months of note-taking and to-do lists at work. Even sadder face.",2
"Great Quality Jacket, but really thin pages.  Not your typical address book.  No sections or categories, just lined pages with only the letter of the alphabet at top of page.  Would not purchase again.",2
"It arrived bent and although I straitened it, it has crinkles in the cover. I'm also surprised that it does not have more cotton in the paper for the price. Maybe leave out the useless back pocket?",2
"Pages are really, REALLY thin and flimsy. You will not be able to draw on the back of your pages unless you want to see the drawings from the reverse side through your new work. If you still want this sketchbook, know that you'll need to put a thicker sheet of paper under every page you work on because even medium pressure will make dents on the opposite page, rendering that one (and possibly a couple more below it) useless too. It's only good for light pencil work. If you do a lot of quick pencil sketches on the go, you might like this. But even in that case there are better small sketchbooks out there.

I was required to have these notebooks for an art class, but I will never purchase them again.

Overall, here's how I'd rate this:
for quick pencil sketching: 3 stars
for everything else: 2 stars",2
Expensive for what they are. Not very substantial in terms of number of pages. I thought they would be lined and was disappointed to see when the order arrived that these were plain. Would not buy again.,2
"Good
-Nice paper
-Great binding
-Nice size
-Lightweight

Bad
-Crap quality cover (I'd like to see synthetic leather, or something besides cardboard)
-Terrible useless pocket... you'll be able to squeeze 5 receipts in here at max, and it'll fling apart whenever it feels like it.
-Typical over-priced chinese product.

I feel ripped off after using the product for some time. The back pocket is pretty much useless, the covers are just generic cardboard. I would pay $5 for the three pack, but almost $9 is a ripoff, and there's nothing that ""wows"" me with these notebooks.",2
"I'm new at watercolor.  I wanted to take this on a trip.  After trying 200  pound cold press, this is very difficult to work on.  It soaks up paint very fast suppose it would be ok for sketching but I'll sketch with a pencil.  Washes don't work well.",2
"Okay these are made in Vietnam and the paper is lousy.  (Moleskine paper quality varies widely depending on the country of origin )

The paper is very thin and asborbs liquid, so ink will feather and bleed.  It is also poor for artwork, except for maybe sketching.

It is useful as a notebook using pencil or a limited selection of regular pens..  any pen that writes wet will just be problematic.

If you want watercolor or an art book, then get a Moleskine made for that purpose.

For fountain pens use the other Cahier journals..

The only positive is the price, but there are better Cahier's made in Turkey that have alot better paper quality.. though not blank.. Ruled or graph is what you will have to buy.",2
This paper is so thin the ink bleeds through terribly. I read all the other reviews that say exactly that but I thought maybe it would be different for my fountain pen. Not so. I suspect that even rollerball pens would bleed through the thin paper. Beautiful journal though. The whole thing is kind of flimsy -- it's definitely not a hard cover. The spine itself is pretty stiff so the cover and pages don't really fold down very flat. If you're looking for a large journal you can roll up and you use pencil or ball point this might work well.,2
"The size and cover quality of this notebook were good for my purposes (research idea notebook). The problem I have with this notebook is that the paper bleeds through when I write with a fountain pen. It has 192 pages (counting front and back), but because the bleed-through is so bad, I can only use one side of the page, giving me only 96 usable pages.  I've tried a dozen or so types of ink. All bleed through (to varying degrees). The only ink I have that does not bleed through on this paper is Noodler's Black.",2
I purchased this as well as the thicker notebook. This product seems cheap and not as useful as the more expensive notebook which has more pages but more $$.,2
"Very small, not many pages.  Made out of recycled papers from some foreign country.  Inferior paper.  Not what I expected as I like to draw in journals I can carry in my purse.  It did not say it was colored papers.......sort of a dirty yellow color.  Not what I wanted at all.  OH well, can write notes in them.",2
"I typically use Moleskine pocket cahiers, which are larger than these extra small notebooks.  I tried these because I wanted something smaller I could stick in my pocket.  These plastic covers would ""seem"" to be so much more durable than the cardboard cahiers but they are not.  The plastic cover separates from the notebook.  It's pretty ugly.  I had to use clear tape to secure all 4 corners as all were peeling badly.  Back to the cahiers for me.  I wish Moleskine would make cahiers in this extra small size.",2
"I WOULD like this notebook if it wasn't for my bullet journal.
It's the never ending battle between two popular brands for bullet journal fans.
I have to say, I can't choose this side of the fan boat.
It was thin paper, very easy to see on other side. Also, doesn't hold well together.",2
"Moleskines are lauded as quality notebooks, but they suffer from poor paper. The paper in these notebooks seems to be the same feathering, bleed through prone paper that is put in the bigger Moleskines. And don't be fooled by the picture, these little notebooks do not have the same smooth cover as the regular Moleskines. The outer cover of these is nothing more than thick black card stock.

When I originally bought these they were around $3.00 for three, and as of this review (3/29/12) they are almost $9.00. They're handy little notebooks worth checking out at $3.00, but at $9.00 they're a complete waste of money, especially considering how bad the paper is.

If you need a little notebook, consider one of Rhodia's offerings. They feature some of the best paper in the world that's fountain pen (and even flex pen) friendly.",2
"I was hopping for a bit better construction, shortly after getting it the cover started to separate to the point that I had to tape the sides.",2
"Basically, the paper is nearly impermeable to water-based inks and watercolors.  Gel pens,  ballpoints, and pencils work OK.  Otherwise, try to use a fountain pen (I used a couple Noodler's inks) / watercolors and the ink will bead up and look terrible.  I can't imagine why they decided to use this paper, it sucks.",2
"Coming from Europe, I find the overall situation with squared notebooks in the US weird. It is like hunting antiquities. This particular notebook is low on pages and sheets are very thin and yellowish. Definitely overpriced.",2
"Boy howdy, this sure is a nice little notebook, but what it's NOT is a reporter notebook. Why? Because reporter notebooks are 4x8. Let us examine why: A 4x8 notebook fits in most back and many front pockets. It is easy to write in a reporter notebook with the opposable thumb, the ring finger and the little finger holding the notebook while at the same time, the index middle fingers hold a digital recorder as if it were a cigar. Despite the compact and portable size, the reporter notebook has a a decent amount of space for note taking. That's why most reporters -- those lying, leftist, corporate rightwing apologist, white priveliged, Obama loving professionals -- use reporter notebooks.

This thing has some good qualities: it is far more durable than a regular reporter notebook, and it has a lot of pages. But it is too dinky to be practical for anything other than your big ideas and grocery lists. It's shortness actually makes it awkward. C-minus. Elsewhere, I review the large Moleskin reporter notebook, which is also not an actual reporter notebook.

(I'm sure some reporter will come on here and say it's perfect and I'm full of crap, but I'll let you in on a little secret: he's a plagiarist.)",2
"Was excited to get these for my bible. Found that all colors but yellow bleed through the pages, not just a little, but a lot. So where I highlighted, the back side of the page looks like I highlighted that as well. The yellow was the only one that did not bleed through, but I think that is because it is almost dried out. There is hardly any color with the yellow.",2
"This pen was one of the worst I have ever used and I am glad I tried it on regular paper a few times before thinking about writing in my study bible.
This pen bleeds through thin pages, ink splotches and gobs up at times and one of the ink's didn't even work at all.
I did find a better Bible pen that lives up to the claims made by ZEBRITE.",2
They bleed through the paper and I'm not pressing too hard.,2
"I found nothing special about these at all other than that they are double tipped.  Even if I am careful, they bleed through. However, the Bibles I am using have very thin paper, even for Bibles.  The best solution I have found is a red art pencil.  It's underlined instead of highlighted, but it gets the job done consistently.",2
"I didn't appreciate these bible tabs, I like the Majesty tabs much better",2
They break way too easily for a book that is used often.,2
"Hard cover is OK, but the At-A-Glance is so much better. Doesn't lay flat to write write on etc.",2
"Hard cover is OK, but the At-A-Glance is so much better. Doesn't lay flat to write write on etc.",2
"Usually get the black hard cover Planner. Ordered the red, cover not as strong, front/back cover and pages get stuck on the spiral binding so its hard to turn the pages. BLACK ONE NEXT TIME!",2
"The red is much more pink than a true red or crimson. Also, it came dented where the elastic band goes around the book. The inside cover is basically a piece of paper glued on, and that wasn't on straight.

I contacted customer service for a replacement. Hopefully this was an isolated incident, but we will see.

Otherwise, I love the layout! The first dozen pages are just the organizer tips and such.

Also, the calendar doesn't start until the last week of June.",2
"Nice idea but it is far too small to really write up your week and plans. I have lots of tasks but I want them to be represented on the Days I've scheduled.  This isn't really feasible here. Then there are lots of blank pages in the back that are utterly worthless.  I would have prefer that the ""week"" be 4 pages instead of two and instead of vertical like Franklin Covey; horizontal like Daytimer.  The goals in the front don't really work with the rest of the planner and so the ""instructions"", ostensibly telling you how to use this thing, are vague, it's sort of a wing and prayer i.e. get started & figure it out.  So, I am returning to Daytimer.  I write larger  even with my  Energel .38 Needlepoint Pen and after all, this, it is bulky to carry in your purse..",2
Too small.  Returned it.,2
I don't like the layout. Too narrow to write in the columns.,2
"Wow. This was quite a surprise. I have a collection of Bibles and have discovered I want tabs in all of them. I have, in the past two years, used about half a dozen different types and brands and sizes of indexing tabs. Though I like some a lot more than others, they are all good -- UNTIL I just used these.

These are incredibly poorly made. In fact, a couple of the tabs left behind their clear adhesive tab while I was gently removing them from the backing. They are very poorly made, small and flimsy. I am greatly relieved that the Bible I added these tabs to is the Bible I use the least. They are  that bad.",2
"I wish I had known how small these were. I can't even read them. I bought them specifically for my large print bible.  Nowhere did it say how small they were. I'd need a magnifying glass to see them. If you don't want small print, move on. Now I have to go buy another set. I'll donate these to the church. The product itself is good though. Just poor advertising on the part of the seller. For this, I have to lower the rating so people will read this and be wary.",2
to small can't handle .,2
Too small.  Returned it.,2
"Im a fan of Cross Pens, and have several, but this particular pen is defective.  It dispenses ink inconsistently, but usually not.  Im seeing it back for repair, so with shipping, Ill have spent considerably more for the pen than I had anticipated.  Ill chalk it up to the 1% defective the makes it past QA/QC.",2
"I like pens a lot, and have several, this one is really nice and good looking and is one of the nicest pen i have write with, its smooth on the writing, have great balance, to make this short is almost the perfect pen, BUT and is a big BUT, the clip to hook the pen to the shirt get loose and the pen no longer holds in place on the shirt its move around on your pocket.

What a big disappointment,  even my $12 bucks parker pen have last twice, my other cross pen are fine but this one is a no good, and i won't century II again.",2
"This pen is my husband's all-time favorite. However, this is the 3rd one I've had to buy for him because after using it daily, the cap loosens, eventually not staying on at all, and the cartridge falls out. He says, after using this pen for YEARS, he'll never buy another one.",2
"beautiful pen, bad nib.  not smooth and it leaks when shaken.",2
Not worth the money.  At best it's just ok.,2
I like the cross pens very much & using since last so many years for personal & gifts use. Unfortunately this time with in a week it stated getting rust though it is an expensive 10 carat gold pen. So I returned. Before I never have such experience. I think it is quality problem & lake of testing the product. Finally I returned.,2
"The pen itself appears to be well constructed and of good quality. The opening and closing operation are very smooth, and I do not get the sense that the pen was cheaply made as is suggested in some of the other reviews. The weight, feel, and grip are all great, and it looks great. However, it fails serve its primary purpose: it does not write! I have had it only a few days, and at first it was great. After signing a few documents it began to skip, and now it is hardly writing at all. In a way, it almost feels wrong to give the pen a bad review based on its bad ink refill, but as it is the original (and included) ink tube, I can't justify a higher star rating.

I'm going to have to buy a new refill and hope that fixes the problem.",2
"cheap body, poor mechanics,  Cross should bring back the 0.9m. Not this thing",2
"I would like this pen more if it were slightly larger and had an in chromed section. At the moment it is entirely too small to write any more than a check's worth of info, and the chrome grip makes it as hardhard to hold as a pen made of ice. The pen wouldbe worth the price if not for its total lack of converter. Not only is this pen too small for even the smallest converters, Cross stated that they have no intention of making one up. Also, good luck finding cartridges when the slim size isn't sold locally.

If you want a novelty sized fountain pen without the novelty ink or price then this is for you.",2
"Made in China. Not the same quality as US made Cross pens. I would rather pay more, but companies are convinced they must sell for the lowest possible price. Would you pay 10 to 15% more for a relatively low priced item that was marketed as being made in the USA? I do wonder how much excessive regulation and taxation has to do with it.",2
"I can't stand the lead feed on this pencil. You have to remove the cap, twist it, press the end to push out some lead, turn it back, replace the cap and then twist the cap EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO EXTEND THE LEAD. So inconvenient and it doesn't work perfectly, it takes fiddling with to get it to work right. Guess it is back to the drawing board to find a pencil that feeds in a simple, usable way.",2
"What?  That doesn't make any sense!  Isn't this a pencil?

The Century model was once available as an actual pencil, with a simple twisting advancing mechanism and a writing tip sized just right for the lead to go through.  Removing the cap and eraser, you had a very large storage area.  You could fit a dozen extra leads in it and write all week without needing to carry a separate box of leads.

Now the ""pencil"" is actually the pen model with a pencil converter inside.  This is lame for several reasons:

1. At the front end, you get an extra tube sticking through the large ballpoint opening with a smaller hole for the lead to come out, which looks much less elegant than the old pencil.  Yes, it's just looks, but you are paying for that.

2. On the inside, the pencil mechanism is a very skinny device no larger than the ballpoint refill (the ""pencil"" essentially contains 2 mechanisms, the ballpoint AND the pencil converter inside of that, leaving little room for storage).  You can fit 3 extra leads in, but then it gets crowded.  Also, though you physically ""twist"" the cap 1/4 turn to advance the lead, it is really operating as one of those complex clickie mechanisms which eventually start to slip.

3. Cross doesn't even bother to make the caps different any more.  In the old days, the black top hat of the pen had a little metal dot on it, and the pencil was just black.  That way you could tell if you were grabbing the pen or pencil out of your cup full of pens.  Now they are both the same (strangely, both WITH the added dot), and you will grab the wrong one 50% of the time.

4. The eraser is much smaller.  With the old pencil mechanism being as wide as the pencil body, the eraser plug was as large as could fit inside it making it almost as large as a normal pencil eraser.  The new one, having to plug into a converter fitted inside a ballpoint-size mechanism, is about half that size.  Not only does it wear down faster, but using a stupid skinny little eraser makes the erasing process take longer.

5. And finally... Cross has switched some of the internal parts to plastic, instead of metal.  It was never an extremely heavy pencil, but it had just enough weight to feel good while writing.  Now it kind of feels cheap.

The only good thing about this new system is that after you get tired of the crummy little eraser and small lead capacity (or after the click mechanism breaks), you can just remove this stupid adapter and replace it with a ballpoint refill.",2
"Deciding to replace the Cross Classic Century ballpoint pen I received as a gift many years ago (and in the intervening years managed to lose), I began a careful search for information in the form of reviews for the pen.  What I read actually led to my having reservations concerning this thought of a replacement purchase; what little information I could find was not...encouraging.
I did finally decide, however, to replace the memory of this Cross pen given to me in 1967 and having done so, I have found the quality to be what I  honestly expected based on all my reading, but a bit less than I had hoped for (eternal optimist that I am).  Through months of use now I am comfortable with the following observations:

  -The manufacturers stamping on the top of the rear tube is clean, clear, and precise - (meaningless, but a nice detail).
  -The join of the tip to the front tube is very nearly perfect.
  -The fit of the rear tube to the front never seems quite right, always leaving a bit of the rear tube lip easily discernible by touch, and is sometimes quite obvious visibly.
  -I have been more than impressed with the functioning of the pen's twist mechanism as it shown no signs of play while smoothly opening and clos-ing the pen.
  -I have decided not to use the clip (relegating this pen to my desk forever) as it seems...weak; not well connected to rear tube and a pen falling from a pocket is always disconcerting.
  -It does seem to collect what most call micro scratches quite readily which does distract from the overall finish of the pen.

I would gladly overlook any, or all of these things had I not experienced such difficulty  with the diameter of the pen...at 0.3 inches I find the pen extremely  narrow and  difficult to hold correctly (very much the opposite of the Lamy Pico and something I had no memory of).  This discomfort does preclude, in fairness, any remarks on quality of writing - if I am not able to hold the pen correctly then I am obviously not able to write well with it.  The length, at nearly 5.25 inches, seems just about right as I hold the pen  and aesthetically the ratio of length to width makes this a remarkably beautiful pen.
All in all I am glad that I decided to purchase it and I do use it often, even though the uncomfortably narrow width and the fit/finish flaws might suggest otherwise.",2
"This pen writes like a standard $0.10 bic pen.  It looks very nice, but the writing quality is ""meh"" at best.

I was pretty disappointed.",2
"I don't know anything about gold, so maybe this is typical, or maybe it is some kind of discoloration.

Whatever the cause, every time I see the 14 karat version of this pen in a store, it looks halfway like copper.  You can see some difference on the Cross website, although their stock image actually looks better than the real thing.

Both the higher-content 18 karat pens AND the lower 10 karat models look more like gold.  If you want a ""gold"" pen, I would save some money and get the cheaper 10 karat model.  It's a little paler than the 18 karat, but it still looks like gold.",2
"I love Cross pens but this one does not have a smooth mechanism nor does it look as good as in the picture.

It has a satin chrome look rather than shiny chrome look, which could be ok I guess, but it just somehow looks cheap.  Personally I love the Century Medallion or Century Black with Chrome touches.  Rather than return this one I'll keep it for use as a backup, give the price.  Caveat Emptor.",2
"Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say ""USA"" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their ""lifetime guarantee,"" only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a ""handling fee"" attached.

I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect.

My advice: if you want a good Cross pen, go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They aren't making them the same anymore.",2

The machine was priced right which is why I chose it.  I've owned it for about a year.  This answering machine is unreliable.  I record my message and the machine drops my message and reverts to the stock message at least once a week.  It also drops the current date and time I enter.  It is frustrating and I am going to buy another answering machine that is a different brand.,2
"I purchased this new drum for my Sharp AL1631 copier that gets light usage, less than 30 copies per week.  It worked fine for a week then started leaving blank areas on copes down the center of the page.  In addition to that, the end of the unit fell off and two gears fell out.  It took me a while to figure out how to reinstall the gears to make the drum work, but the blank spots continued.  I thought that it may be the new toner cartridge that I had installed at the same time, but even after purchasing a second new toner cartridge, the blank spots are still there.  The first 2 or 3 copies are fine, then the blank gets wider and wider.  I finally decided to just buy a new copier and stop spending money on new parts and supplies.  Of course, this was what I was trying to avoid in the first place.",2
Created dirty pages and had to replace immediately,2

"I bought this because I was under the impression that the TI-92 would be more advanced than the TI-89.  Nope.
This calculator was put out of production over a decade ago!
You can't get updates or downloads anymore...skip it.

I replaced it with the TI-Nspire CAS.  Now THAT's a calculator!  Dang, it does everything and does it so well...so my recommendation--get the Nspire CAS instead.  It's worth the extra few dollars.",2
"I ordered another calculator to replace this one. I'll keep it as a backup but the shape of this thing is horrible, it rocks around due to the curves when sitting on a desk and trying to use it, and is not ergonomic when holding it. Also due to the extra width and slippery shiny plastic, it is impossible to use one handed as when you reach your thumb across to hit a button on the far side, it slides out of your hand because there is no texture to it.",2
"This is my second HP 12C calculator. The first one lasted from 1982 to 2014, and it was solidly built. This new one, purchased in 2014 is already showing signs of pending failure (not due to batteries getting low - I've checked). This one is more cheaply built than my old one, and I am quite disappointed in its performance and the cheap ""feel"" of the calculator in general. The keys do not have that solid feel to them. All in all, I would not recommend this calculator.",2
"This scientific calculator pretty much sucks. It's a one line calculator and doesn't do that much. It's so hard keeping track of numbers and parenthesis and things. I feel like you could buy something similar at the dollar store. You have to punch the numbers really slowly or else the calculator will miss it.

Confusing to use at times, especially bad during tests. For example if an answer is something like 3.5 x 10^11 (which is 350000000000) the calculator will show this number as ""3.5^11"" (which is 965491.57) even though it means to say 3.5x10^11. Standard calculators are supposed to use E to show this (as in 3.5E10), because the other way indicates a completely different value. So confusing.",2
The view angle is whack.  I have to hover right over the display to read the screen.  The buttons are squishy and don't always register when pressed.  Calculator tech needs to get with the times.,2
Didn't last three months into the school year in a backpack with a high schooler.,2
"I read the negative reviews about the keypad but bought an HP 12C anyway  thinking the others might be more picky than me.  Unfortunately the only way to be certain a digit is entered is to carefully and firmly press the key. The tactile feedback does NOT mean the digit has been registered. Im a slow fingered user but even I would find my calculations were wrong because I pressed the operator key before confirming the value on the display.
Most new users find RPN confusing and refuse to learn it. That keeps existing users like me the prime customers for new HP calculator products. Unless the keypad reverts to its previous quality this will be my last purchase. Of the many 12Cs Ive owned and given away there has never been a failure. My oldest 12C was actually made in the USA! My old HPs will probably last another 20 years; long enough to get me to the grave.
 The new calculator was lightning fast. I will miss that but I returned the 12C for a refund.
With new users reluctant to try RPN and old users like me deserting, HP will be forced to discontinue this product line. I hope someone in the company pays attention to these reviews and acts to save them.",2
"While this calculator has some new and good features, I HATE that they changed all the old keys around.  I don't want to dork around figuring out the new key sequences and hunting for keys that no longer exist...like the SUM key.  Where is it?  The keyboard is too different from the old keyboard.  They should have kept the old and added new as required.  I get so sick of electronics folks moving all the furniture, just so they can feel clever.  It is disruptive and time consuming to constantly have to figure out stupid process issues about where keys are newly located instead of just being able to use all the familiar keys and learn the new ones or new extra functions.  Not impressed.  I just want a TI-30 scientific calculator with solar power, but those are now $99.  It's ridiculous.  This may be my last Texas Instruments calculator, and I've been a fan since 1979.  Seriously, BAD MOVE with the keyboard layout.",2

But the functions are no good if the keys stop working...",2
very hard to try and understand something like with no real instruction boob .,2
"The terrible keypad on this calculator ruins all of its good points for me. Keys are sloppy, don't provide any feedback and are very easily bumped without knowing it.

I just can not stand using the thing because of the horrible keypad.",2

"I ordered the green one for a college math course. Feels incredibly cheap and flimsy. The buttons are loose and crooked. Wondering if this isn't a knock-off. Having said that, at least it works.",2
This calculator work but that's about all i can say. it usually takes several times of pushing the same button for it to register the desired number. That said it can be really annoying to use. If ur looking for a decent calculator I would go with something else. Overall I was not too pleased with it.,2
"Forced to buy this because my professor doesn't allow graphing calculators. You can tell this is bottom of the barrel just to get the job done. TI-80 series are much more expensive but well worth the premium. The button feel on this calculator is gross and will slow you down, which is crucial on tests.",2
It's worth spending a little more to get a different model.  The keys are not the easiest to press and they don't always register that I have pressed the key.  I have to be very careful to make sure each button I press registers because it can throw off your calculations.,2

My work as an R&D machinist cutting into costly one-off prototype parts requires me to avoid errors as much as possible, so I bought a new battery-only TI-30Xa as a replacement. Well that is OK but it powers down pretty soon if left for a few minutes. I often like to refer back to my last result to remind/reassure myself that I have not had a brain fart, and my old solar one would stay on indefinitely as long as the lights were on.

So I saw this solar powered TI-30XIIS in pink for sale for about $6 at a local store. The first thing my co-worker said when he saw me with a pink calculator was ""That was on sale really cheap, wasn't it?"" Well I thought the 2 line display would be an advantage, because now I could reassure myself about my last inputs as well as my last result. And it is good that way. I can even recall and review previous calculations. And I have not had the button feel or button reliability problems reported by many others here.

Unfortunately, this thing powers down just as fast as the TI-30Xa, even in bright light. Plus I do not like the arrangement of the buttons... It has the ""ON"" button down in the lower left while my other TI calculators had them in the upper right, and other things have been shuffled around as well. Texas Instruments must be taking lessons on confusing customers from Microsoft; how about the automakers adopt this tactic and experiment with gas pedals on the left and brakes on the right? How would that work out? Also this calculator is lacking the 1/x button, which I happen to use very often. And the frequently-used square root key has been demoted to a ""2nd"" function.

It is too bad they could not add the new advantages without scrambling up the good things they had before. Hey Texas Instruments, how hard is it to respect -- and take full advantage of -- the speed habits that you yourselves have built up in your customers?",2
Didn't work good enough for me. I ended up getting a free app for my droid the worked better than this.,2
"purchased for my daughter for advanced math program.  Was used for 6 months, stored for summer and used again in fall for two months until buttons stopped working.  Understand it's not expensive, but with the cover, that should protect the buttons and it should not have to be replaced every 9 months--too late to return, but no longer any good.
Purchased another this fall for my son (in green) hoping it lasts longer than 9 months.",2
"Overall I do not recommend this product. I remember this calculator from several years ago during various math classes. Bought this as a replacement as I require a calculator with specific test specifications. Works great and very intuitive, however the keys require just enough more pressure than they used to so that it is annoying. Perhaps they will become broken in. Not yet though.",2
Why would you use chrome plated keys without some sort of contrasting lettering on them? Crappy looking chrome plating at that. Since my vision is not what it used to be I had to return this unit.,2
My calculator came without cover and that's not what I expected I was disappointed because that wasn't what the image displayed.,2
"I have always loved TI calculators, but the buttons on this calculator are too hard to press.  Sometimes it feels like you pressed the number, but it does not register on the screen.  It does not happen too often, but it is often enough that you have to constantly look at the screen while you are entering numbers just to make sure they registered.

The screen is also a little washed out.  After cursing my new TI-30X IIS a number of times, I bought a

The buttons always register, and the screen has great contrast.  Unfortunately, my days of trusting TI calculators are over.",2
Ordered this calculator expecting there to be flowers on the calculator and instead it was pink and white. Returning it most likely,2
"Parents: If you're going to buy your child a graphing calculator for school, DON'T insult his/her intelligence with this limited function calculator. Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college. What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs, GREs, AP tests, high school, algebra, calculus 1-3, college, etc...

If you buy a TI-83, you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82, which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.

GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math, but it's a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III. I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3, but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.

For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work:
The TI-83 is a piece of junk. It's for kiddies in 6th grade.

The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.

The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its ""pretty print"" and units system. Plus with the right software mods, you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.

However I realize you're just trying to find info on the TI-83. My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is: don't bother. It's a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86. It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college (Calculus I-III). A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.

It's like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari. It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well. The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum. It can tackle small stuff but will hold its own when the big beasts come around.",2
I bought this so that my wrist would not hurt. I guess I was wrong!. This is as hard as the one I just threw out. Guess I  will look for another.,2
"This mouse pad just feels cheap. There is a distinct neoprene smell that emanates from it that I don't experience with higher end mouse pads. The bottom surface is not particularly sticky and tends to slide around a bit on my desk. But the major issue is that the wrist rest makes a crunching sound when I rest my wrist on it. It doesnt sound nor feel like a gel; it sounds and feels like cheap foam. My wrist rest also came with a pre-dented center, as though it had been used for years (though it was sealed in blister-pack, so it decidedly wasn't used before.",2
I found this was uncomfortable while it was being used.  It didn't fit my needs at all.,2
Good,2
"It was too small and the wrist pad was pretty not squishy. We got rid of it. On the plus side, no purchasing issues and it arrived when promised.",2
"Has lost a lot of support, and I have it less than 6 months.",2
Poor quality. Didn't feel comfortable with this.,2
"I have a job that requires 8 plus hours of computer use a day.  Recently, I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel, Radial Tunnel, and Ulnar Nerve (I think the term was ulcerations) in both arms.  I was in a bit of a panic when I bought this pad, so at the time I was looking for anything that would be helpful.  Purchasing this to use as a support for my right wrist was a mistake.  When I rested my wrist on the pad it made the pain worse because it pushed directly on some of the problem spots.  If you are dealing with similar medical issues, I strongly recommend purchasing a wrist brace like the one linked here:

https://www.amazon.com/Support-Adjustable-Breathable-Arthritis-Tendinitis/dp/B00IJJXS4O/ref=sr_1_7_s_it?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1468185105&sr=1-7

Which ever brace you choose, just make sure that you get one that keeps your wrist straight while providing enough support to prevent further compression of the problem never(s).",2
"I use my computer a LOT, sometimes 12-18 hours a day when busy with graphics work. I started getting sore between by thumb and wrist, where my hand rested on my desk, so I tried this pad. It worked GREAT at first -- but then the 'gel' pad (I think it is actually foam) started to flatten out and get hard. Now it's not any better than the desk. Good product, but it doesn't last!",2
"The gel pad is way too rigid and way too high. I can't use it. But for this price, I don't bother returning.",2
Didn't last long,2
Well it did last a few days before the wrist support totally collapsed. Now it has a big dent in the wrist support and provides very little support. I have had several wrist supports but never had one collapse like this. Update 2 years later totally trashed.,2
I was replacing an old belkin waverest mouse pad with this one. Its been a few years so it was time. They must make them differently now. The wrist rest was extremely uncomfortable and gave me pain in my arm. I had to switch back to my old one. This is just sitting on my desk gathering dust now. I'll be buying a different one in the oval shape with hopefully a better wrist rest on it like my old ones have always had. Not sure what rock material this is made of now. It sucks.,2
Bad smell,2
The price was reasonable but it lacked quality. Would purchase something better I could have tried it out first!,2
Doesn't feel like it's a high quality pad. $2 should be a fair price.,2
"At first, this mouse pad was AWESOME. Then after about a week of use the part that holds your wrist up went flat and was useless. So... you get what you pay for... If you are going to use this every day I would suggest just saving a little more money and getting a more expensive one.",2
the gel is too soft and compresses easily. Would be looking for another in the near future.,2
The wrist part is nice.  The base pad is too small and slows down my mouse's tracking.,2
"It's a fair price, but the mouse roller face is starting to delaminate already and I've only used it for a few weeks now. I won't be buying another. There are too many on the market to try that might be higher quality. Mouse pads are ""dime a dozen"".

The gel wrist rest is a nice feature.",2
"I usually use the Casio FC-200V which is, in my humble opinion, the greatest Financial Calculator out there. I had to buy this calculator for a class and wish I didn't need it. It feels like Dollar Store level quality in my hands, only has one line for numbers (especially annoying if you're dealing with cash flows or payment calculations), and is almost too lightweight. Unfortunately, every calculation in our finance class is done on this calculator. I'm pretty sure there's some sort of backdoor business dealing between Texas Instruments and every college textbook manufacturer out there because there is no other explanation for why every business finance course requires this clunky piece of junk.

If you're looking for a calculator to use for work, do yourself a favor and get one with more than one line on the screen (like my blessed Casio).
If you're just looking at the reviews because some nutty professor said you needed this one, it's functional and serves its purpose but if you can get away with a different calculator, I think you'll know which one I'd recommend.",2
"I've had this gel wrist-rest/mouse pad for a couple of months now.

I like the mouse pad. It is thick and does an admirable job of giving a smooth mousing surface.

The gel pad was initially too firm and too high. With use, the gel is settling in the middle, while remaining high on the sides, creating a little ""cradle"" for my wrist.

I still don't find it comfortable, and will likely replace this mouse pad with a simpler one, resuming my use of a bead-filled wrist rest.",2
"Not so pleased with this. The wrist rest ends up being more on my lower forearm rather than my wrist and it's beginning to hurt. I'm just about to go back to the old mouse pad, coffee stains and all.",2
"This is the poorest product I've gotten from Belkin. The gel pad is very bad. When you push down in the center of the gel pad it will inflate the texture on the mouse pad, it looks defective almost. Then some of the air is out of the gel pad, so it's not really round. I would say this is the worst mouse pad you can possibly buy, but it was a cheap price so I can accept giving it 2 stars.",2
Purchased 3 wrist support mouse pads and we have used them for about 1 month now.  One of he wrist support sags terribly in the center of the support creating two distinct ridges which are uncomfortable.  The pad is supposed to conform to the wrist for maximum comfort.  It appears to lack sufficient gel in the pad to maintain its shape properly.  Another pad has a noticeably air bubble.  I would consider another brand.,2
"I've owned this mouse pad twice before, and I have to say... this mouse pad SMELLS TERRIBLE. And I'm not just talking about the fresh manufacturing chemical smell either. This mouse pad gets dirty and STAYS DIRTY, and smells worse over time! On top of that, the terrible smell will embed itself into your wrist, so you can carry the smell around with you!

Even washing this mouse pad in the damned sink with scented soaps ONCE A WEEK doesn't do any good. The same smell just comes back, stronger than ever. And I doubted myself too for a while, saying maybe it's my dead skin cells sluffing off into the material. But when I got my brand new mouse pad this week, I instantly recognized the same damned smell on it.

Screw this mouse pad. It just arrived in the mail for me today, and I kid you not, I've already ordered a different one. As soon as it gets her, I'm throwing this piece of s*** out.",2
"This Belkin product is not what I expected, i.e., The cushion fails to supply enough support, and the mouse area is in need of more territory, so to speak. Overall, this item is 2nd class, and a poor value!",2
"These things are not well made. The main problem is the ""hump"" that the wrist lies on is not well attached to the base. As a result the ""hump"" becomes disconnected from the base. Mine fell apart within about 8 months (albeit I used it very intensely [i.e., just about every day for a few hours a day]). The problem is that it is poorly glued on. Belkin should have, at the very least, used a better glue. Ideally it should have been stitched or stapled on. That way it would not fall off.",2
"One star is for how well my laser mouse tracks and how smooth it is for my pinkie sliding on it.
The second star is for the width of the pad, it's just barely enough.

Minus 2 stars is for the hard ""gel"". And minus the 3 star for the caved in part which is caving in more in just a few weeks.

I have to look for another one.",2
"There is a big dent (intentional) in the wrist part of the pad. Instead of putting my wrist in a natural position, it cranks it up too high. Completely defeats the purpose of the wrist rest, and you can't tell from the picture on amazon that this is the case.",2
"I bought this to replace a Belkin Gel Mouse Pad I've had for years.  It's not made the same way at all.  It's much more stiff and doesn't contain the same type of gel at all.  There is a pointless dent in the middle of the wrist support which does not exist on the original, older product.  I can see now, by looking more closely at the photo, that the dip is accurately portrayed in the photo, but I didn't notice when it just looked so much like the older model.  Not worth sending back, but I wish I could find another *original* Belkin mouse pad.",2
"I've also been buying these for years.  Just to confirm, they have dramatically changed the wrist pad portion of this.  It used to be a squishy but supportive gel, almost similar to the consistency of a thick dough.  Now if feels like a fairly hard foam.  It's not nearly as comfortable.  Really disappointing.

One tip - adjust your chair height and the level of your elbow, relative to the height as the surface the mouse is on.  See if it changes the amount of weight you put on your wrist, and where the pressure point is - it may be more comfortable.  For me, I like to have my elbow as high as the desktop that the mouse is on.",2
"It was ok at first, but the surface gleen wore off quickly and the wrist rest collapsed down, offering not much support after a month or so",2
"I had a Belkin mouse pad like this for at least 6 years, possibly longer, and it was still going strong, in perfect shape when I gave it to my aunt and got myself a new one about 4 months ago.

As stated in my headline, I seem to have a lemon this time. The fabric that's supposed to be ""welded"" tight over the entire surface of the pad like skin has pulled away from about 30% of the surface, and is continuing to do so.

I called Belkin - which was no fun, btw - and they're going to replace it ... AS LONG AS I first send them this faulty one, paying the postage. That means I'll probably have to go for a few weeks without a mouse pad. Drats!

Because of my experience with the previous pad, I'm going to try again. I figure my chances of getting another lemon are slim. However, if this is representative of the way they're currently made ... well, I'll worry about that bridge if and when I come to it.",2
"This is a good calculator as would be expected from Texas Instruments, who have been in the calculator business for decades.  A calculator should do the functions that it is supposed to do, which this calculator does.  However, like several other's have noted, the keys can be a challenge.  I've had to start over after entering a number due to the numbers not enterring as they should have.  A good press of the keys takes care of that issue, but most calculators do not need to have the keys pressed firmly for the correct operation...  If Texas Instruments could redesign around the key issue, this would be a five star calculator, as the case and display are well designed. I have only used this calculator for a total of maybe 15 - 20 hours, and the keys may work better over time, but I have not seen any change during the timeframe noted.

Update 6/16/11 - I'm hoping that I ended up with a lemon, and that this is not an indicator of TI's quality standards.  I'm dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.  The decimal button works only when pressed firmly as do several other buttons on this calculator.  When taking a timed test in a finance class, this calculator really failed me because of these issues.  Even being aware of the issues with the calculator I found myself having to redo calculations several times for most of the problems due to the calculator not taking the decimal point.  In over thirty years of using calculators I have never had one with issues like this.  At this point, I'd only recommend this calculator to my enemies, not my friends.",2
"I already have a Texas Instruments BA-35 Financial calculator that I purchased back in 1993. It has served me well. A few weeks ago I misplaced it. After two days of searching, I gave up, and purchased this BAIIplus to replace it.  Luckily, I found the BA-35 a day later.  When this new calculator arrived, I was really disappointed in it. First, it FEELS CHEAP...second, it is HUGE and CLUNKY and has a very awkward hard shell that you must REMOVE then snap onto the BACK. It took several tries to get the calculations sequence figured out...there are some minor changes from the previous calculator.  I will use this as a backup, but it is too large and I hate that pop-off cover.(the old one is slim, and came with a nice flip-open vinyl case, with an interior pocket where I keep the instructions, should I need them.)",2
"Yah.  Same part number, but cheapened out like crazy.  I was a huge fan of the original (like others), but this one is a couple inches shorter in length, about 60% in height, and narrower as well.  The foam is not nearly as soft.  As I type in the ""home row"" position, my wrists are mostly on the edge and not on the flat part.  Totally different product and not comfortable.  I can't understand why manufacturers can't figure out how to make a decent wrist rest.  They seem to only care about cost and making a cheap product.",2
"You may have noticed how many reviewers remark on the low quality of the T50.

Having used one myself, I can confirm that they are true and accurate.

After being so disappointed in this stapler, I did further research and discovered a much better option built by Tacwise: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091CECNE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0091CECNE&linkCode=as2&tag=todmedblo-20&linkId=GSK2JZM2LMJEI2U4

Though their stapler is more expensive, after the endless hours wasted, spent trying to unjam this T50, I can assure you that buying the higher-quality is a very good investment.

I hope you found this helpful - feel free to ask any questions you might have!",2

"The really disappointing thing isn't how well the stamps work. It's the back-end with Endicia. Right after purchasing the labels and using them in my Dymo 450 Turbo (which is a great little printer), I ordered postage and loaded the wrong labels into the machine. Of course,  I didn't realize this till I ran about $50 of postage. I requested a refund from Endicia. The refund process is long and requires the stamps printed in error AND the pieces you intended to mail are returned. Admittedly, I didn't do that, because I was mailing materials which already cost me money. I explained that in detail on the form (which you mail into Endicia (costing you more in postage, Ironic, no?) Never got a response. Checked my account today and discovered that my refund request was rejected. As of right now, I guess it's because I didn't want to send Endicia sales materials and padded envelopes that cost small businesses like mine money. Bottom line: Dymo makes a great product. The labels work really well. But I will deal with the long lines at the PO before I give another nickel in postage or fees to Endicia. My advice to Dymo is to lose Endicia.",2
"I'm using these labels on a Dymo 450 Turbo on a Mac.

If you were hoping to use these labels to print Paypal shipping, look for the one-part labels instead. Even after a lot of fiddling, you cannot get these labels to print postage correctly (it will print sideways from Paypal, meaning only a portion of the tracking number is printed, the rest is blank) unless you do a clever workaround in Cups and Photoshop. Even then, it prints backwards (the postage prints where it says ""return"" and ""recipient"" and the return and recipient prints where it says ""postage"". So you have to pull all four pieces (even the bit that's meant to be thrown away) off the strip and pieces them back together on the packaging. It looks incredibly unprofessional, and you have to do a bit of resizing in Photoshop as well because the only settings Paypal has for Labelwriter 330 and 330 Turbo, whose labels are 7.5"", not 7"" like these.

Normally I'd have given these labels an okay rating, but then I found out that Dymo won't even give out the template for this label, or ANY internet postage labels! According to their troubleshooting page, these labels are only compatible Stamps.com or Endicia. I wish they'd printed this on the box or put that in the product description - unfortunately I wasted $16.",2
"Unless you are printing custom postage to justify the cost per label ($0.11ea as of of this review) I can't see why you wouldn't just buy stamps.

The printer works great. But this is one of those ??? moments where you wonder who thought this was a good deal.",2
"We bought these labels for our children's ministry to ""tag"" the kids.  They don't stay on the fabric... I'm looking for a better product.",2
"So far, Dymo-brand tapes have been the least reliable and least useful, as well as the most expensive. Dymo's ""standard"" tapes come with a ""temporary"" adhesive that most users will find useless unless they use their labeler to label paper products like file folders. ""Compatible"" tapes generally have a much stronger adhesive on them.

I have mostly ""compatible"" tape, and a few Dymo brand. Whenever I have had an adhesion or feed problem, the release liner has had ""DYMO"" printed on it. The 1"" tape that came with my printer got thoroughly wrapped around the soft feed roller in the printer -- there appears to be no way to release the roller to let the miswound tape spool off. What a mess! ""Compatible"" tapes have never misfed for me.",2

Not very happy with this stuff. Doesn't stick to itself or wires well at all. Works fine for sticking to some surfaces. I do like how they are split in the middle so removing the backing is easy.,2
Neither the green or pink will feed itself.  The black on white cartridge I bought from dymo works great but the colored ones won't feed.  Very disappointed,2

Did not work,2
"I have 2 DYMO Letra Tag Label makers and in general I like them. I use the plastic tape to label my spice jars. While the print holds up to the frequent handling, the labels don't stay stuck to the glass bottles.

They also don't like to stick to the plastic caps.

I am disappointed with this product, but haven't found anything better.

BTW - The metallic tape was no better.",2
this would be great if the labeler it goes with worked.  i have tried 4 and have had to send every one back because they are cheaply made and quit working,2
"Wow...Is this stuff suppose to stick on file folders?
Just ordered another roll...this one is less sticky.
Having to literally tape all of the labels on. DISAPPOINTED!",2
"Does not work very well.  The rolls ""stick"" and you need to pull out about a foot of the leader to get them started and throw it away.  I only found this ""solution"" to throw some away on a web site suggesting the rolls have ""been stored too long"".  My concern is if it sits in the label maker over time, I'll have to ""re-throw away"" some more.  Frankly, I'd expect this is it was made in China but this came from Belgium so I had higher expectations from a company doing this for 50 years.",2
First roll worked great.  Second two rolls took some elbow grease to get started and I lost a few inches of tape as a result.,2
"Both cartridges were apparently over-filled (I thought), and would not feed the tape to print it.  The machine could not pull the tape out of the cartridge for some reason.  Eventually, after tugging gently on the tape, I figured there was nothing to lose, so I grabbed and pulled very hard.  Finally, the tape barely began to be pulled from the inside, and after I'd wasted a foot of tape (a full 10% of the entire roll), it was loose enough that the machine could feed it properly.  After that, printing was fine.

When I inspected the cartridges more closely, I saw that the inside of the cartridge is fairly visible from one side, and there is clearly a huge amount of empty space on the inside of the tape area, so it's not a matter of being over-filled.  These are only 10 foot tapes, whereas I  currently have a 23 foot black-on-white cartridge that has exactly the same amount of space inside the cartridge for tape.  With the much longer tape, it simply winds further inside the empty space, leaving less space in the middle of the circular area containing the remaining tape.  For whatever reason, these two cartridges have the tape very tightly pushed up against the outside edge of the circular area containing the tape supply, and the inside end of the tape isn't loosely unwinding itself into the middle to give the tape some slack (like it does with the 23 foot long cartridge).

Bottom line: if you have the same problem of the machine trying to print but nothing comes out, grab the colored portion (not the black character tape underneath it in the cartridge) and pull it as hard as you have to, to get it started.  Once you've pulled it far enough to be able to feel that it's feeding fairly easily, try re-installing the cartridge and it will probably work fine.  It's just sad to have to waste 10% of the entire supply on both cartridges in this package.

ADDED: As a Vine reviewer, I do not see the selling price, and hadn't gone to look at that before the review.  Before this edit, I had rated this a 3-star product because of the wasted tape due to the apparent internal defect in both cartridges.  I have now downgraded it to a 2-star rating after seeing the price.  I already own one of these Dymo label makers, and recently ordered a black-on-white cartridge that is 23 feet long (more than the combined total of these two cartridges).  As with prior cartridges, there were no problems with the tape feeding, unlike these two shorter (10' ""Neon"" cartridges).  Yet the price of the 23' tape is only 54% of these two 10' tapes (20' combined).  There's no way that more than twice as much tape should be half the price of a double-pack of the same tape just because they're using different colors in the plastic.  Yes, the two cartridges cost pennies more than one cartridge package, but they're selling in bulk, thus saving costs there on packaging.

Worse, I just recently ordered (and received) a replacement 23' cartridge because the old one was getting close to empty.  After doing the initial review of this Vine product, I decided to see if it feeds OK.  It does not!  It too had to be pulled out of the cartridge, though not as far as the 10' cartridges, before it would feed automatically during printing.  It appears that Dymo has a manufacturing problem that goes well beyond these new little 10' ""neon"" cartridges.  The problem is now also in the old standard 23' cartridges as well - a fundamental manufacturing issue.",2
"I have 2 DYMO Letra Tag Label makers and in general I like them. I use the plastic tape to label my spice jars. While the print holds up to the frequent handling, the labels don't stay stuck to the glass bottles. No matter how carefully I clean the jars before applying the label they start peeling from one end or the other (and sometimes both).

They also don't like to stick to the plastic caps.

I am disappointed with this product, but haven't found anything better.

BTW - The metallic tape was no better.",2
Too expensive,2
"I use my Palm V as an address book, calendar and to-do list, with a few digital notes. I also have the Dooney & Bourke Palm V Case and the Palm travel kit.
The Palm V is sleek and attractive, but has a few major flaws:
1. The on button is not protected from being constantly activated by the case, causing the batteries to drain extremely fast.
2. The flimsy cover that it comes with is not sufficient. Everybody that I know that has a palm, bought an additional case. The original case should at least be usable.
3. The reset button does not clear memory, forcing me to wait for the batteries to die to clear it. No bulk delete option is provided.
4. There is no USB option provided with the basic Palm for synching with USB devices.
5. The rechargeable built-in battery is nice if you don't leave your cradle for more than a week, but nasty if you travel.
In short, the Palm V has potential, but some simple design flaws and the need to buy a number of add-ons just to make it functional are simply unacceptable at that price tag.
For my needs, I'm going to the REX 6000. It is far less expensive, much more portable, and provides both USB and PCMCIA synching out of the box.",2

The odor it emits is enough reason not to buy this product. It's strong and unpleasant. Buy something else.,2
"Agree with other reviewers. This is NOT the same quality as the original. I ordered a few of these and sent all but one back since a client seemed to like.  The biggest downside is the wrist pad is smaller, harder, and does not come off of the plate like it use to. I still have my original (60143) on my desk after 10+ years and am completely satisfied.. was simply hoping to pass on a quality product. No joy here.",2
"The product itself looks to be what I need, however, product came in an open package and product looked used. I think I paid enough for a new mousepad and not a return item. Probably will not ever buy from this seller again. That practice is very unprofessional.",2
"After reading all the reviews and having my own experiences, I've concluded two main factors affect these reviews:
1. Functions - Siemens has produced two different versions.  Newer versions have some important features missing in original version. They are a)ability to transfer directories and b)ability to turn private mode off (allows user to join call without having to have call transferred to them)
2. Reliability - Siemens has had ongoing quality problems. This explains why some users rave about the phone and others complain severely.  Both groups of users are reporting their experiences accurately.
I've experienced both excellent performance and lousy performance with my phones. the base unit was replaced once.  I have replaced two handsets.  I just ordered third handset replacement (LCD failed after a week).  Siemens warrantly replacement is straightforward, fast, and cost free (they pay shipping). They don't even ask for proof of purchase.  But I strongly suspect they have had so many quality problems, that they gave up trying to ask for proof of purchase. There's a never ending supply of refurbished Siemens phones for sale. It seems they've had long run of quality problems, only to exascerbate them by recycling the phones through the refurb program.  They need to destroy these phones, rather than refurb and recycle them.  A refurb is what you get as a warranty replacement.
I fully expect to be replacing these phones every 1-2 months until my patience runs out. Unfortunately, no other vendor makes a comparable 2-line phone. Yes, I tried the Panasonic and found its functionality was sorely missing in critical areas for me.",2
"I bought it here it was supposed to be NEW and Genuine.
But I got an opened unit, NO seal, NO yellow cover, NO instructions, NO orig box, it was just wrapped hastily in bubble wrap (small bubbles single layer) and put in an already used amazon box with cracks.  Upon inspection, the roller was dusty and had hair on it!
I left a poor review for the seller, but he begged me to delete the review and for shipping refund. If anything I should have returned the item but I needed to use it.  Upon use it leaked all over the place, I had to spend a long time maintaining the unit and wiping with dry (not wet) paper towels.  It worked for a day and then slowly it leaked all over again!  The fax came in all totally smudged with ink. I thought my machine was old and had a tech come over to look, We replaced the toner and it worked fine, WTH?! I pay good money for bad crap, never again! $65 here vs $99 @ Office Depot, but you get what you pay for!",2

"Purchased mine from Home Depot several years ago.

"Really cheaply made out of gold-colored pot metal. They work, but I don't expect them to last.",2
"I think the metal is OK and the metal point part on mine seems fine after a few usses.  The part that holds the pen is difficult to get adjusted correctly, but it does allow the ability to use various pens which offsets any difficulty in adjusting the holder in my opinion.  I use a silver leather pen to mark details on leather for stitching marks and other design elements.  It has been difficult to find a good compass for my needs.

Unfortunately, the adjustment mechanism that is the key component for setting the distance between the two arms is inadequate.  It does not hold the two arms at a fixed distance.  Instead, if you are pushing harder or lighter, drawing on material that has more resistance, etc. the arm distance can move a couple millimeters.",2
"First of all, let me say I am extremely happy with the seller's response. Problem was that while it was in the original packaging, it had expired 4 months ago. The packaging was taped up and looked like it had been battered. When I opened it I discovered the expiration date. I contacted the seller who immediately apologized and gave me a full refund. Also, didn't want the one sent to me returned. This is the kind of seller I sincerely appreciate. Said he or she didn't realize it was old and was taking immediate steps to check the other cartridges in stock.",2
"I have had 3 of these Visor Deluxes over the last 3 years and all I can say is I hope my new Sony lasts longer.  It sure works better than the Visor Deluxe. My advice, get a Palm or Sony.  Forget Handspring until the quality goes up>>>",2
"I really wanted to like this Jornada. But when I got it it just didn't feel right in my hand. The cover - which apparently others like - I hated it. The requirement to store the stylus in the cover is okay, but when you don't use the cover and put it in a pack or case there is no where to store  the stylus - that can be a problem.
The screen is not as bright as I had  hoped. I am new to Windows based handhelds, but in PocketPC OS it is  EXTREMELY difficult to shut down an application, and when you get 10 or so  different things running it gets SLOOOOOOOW.
HP usually turns out  intuitively designed products, but the wheel for scrolling is useless due  to its placement. The aforementioned placement of the stylus holder was an  issue, and then comes my biggest complaint: the CF slot cover. This little  flimsy piece of plastic which is designed to cover the empty (or full) CF  slot, but it is very cheaply made and poorly attached - I gave it about a  week before it would have broken off; and its placement was such that I hit  it all the time.
The multimedia was fair, mp3 files sounded good with or  without the headphones, but the player ... [is poor] and I never could get any sort  of avi or mpeg video files to play as indicated. Even with USB connection,  it took forever to download mp3s to the 548.
COST - VERY EXPENSIVE! For  that price it should be manufactured with better materials.
There are  virtuosly no accessories for it. An external keyboard is nonexistant. There  are two companies with ads in the Accessory guide who show external  keyboards, but upon further checking - neither makes one for the 540 series  of Jornadas.
If you want to really be efficient, I would reccomend the  HP Jornada 690 it has the same memory with better battery life, an internal  modem, a built in keyboard and more.
It works as promised, but isn't as  exciting or valuable as it claims. In time, I am sure there will be better  accessories and programs, but for now - I'll keep my paper organizer and  pen, its faster, cheaper, and unlimited storage! Palm organizers are  simpler and, in most circumstances, better; unless you NEED color and  multimedia.",2
"As ""presentation paper"" I'm not happy with the results. It just doesn't have the color vibrancy I expect. It seems equivalent to my usual non-presentation ""bright white"" paper. I've used the Epson premium presentation paper, however, and am really happy with that.",2
Too thin. If you're going to buy this brand be sure to get the 'Premium' paper.,2

"I bought several of these at a local store.

When hand ironed, the tshirt did not hold to a couple of normal washes.
After I purchased a heat press and used it for 30s on 350F, the tshirt does hold under wash.

However, in both cases, the transferred image is ""hard"" and the tshirt cracks after the transfer.

There is better transfer paper available - just not in local retail stores. I purchased JPSS transfer paper instead. It is less expensive than this Epson paper, about half the cost per sheet, but you have to buy larger quantities. I am very happy with the results with JPSS so far.

Unless you are planning on never wearing your shirts, I wouldn't recommend this transfer paper.",2

Cheap quality.  Will chip off shirt if washed.  Luckily I just made bday shirts and then had to throw away the shirts after the first wash.  Actually started chipping at the party.

Not sure why these are called 2.5 Inches by 3.5 Inches??  Right on the front cover it state the size as 2.9 Inches by 3.8 Inches (74 mm x 99 mm).  I thought 2.5 x 3.5 would be perfect but that's not the actual size of these pouches.,2

The sequence for SL-200TE is: input 100, press X, input 10, press %, press +.  Answer 110.  Casio tech support's explanation was that the SL-200TE is programmed differently.  No mention of this appears on the instruction page.  I was hoping that the SL-200TE was just a larger version of the SL-100L but it appears to have a different logic chip.  It isn't worth the effort for me to deal with them or to return them.  Off to the yard sale.",2
"Looking at this product's picture it appears that the top hinged part can be used in an upright position.  This is mis-leading.  When you open it and flip the top up, it is designed to lay back in a flat position.  It seems designed to use on a flat surface more than a hand-held type of calculator.  It is about 4-3/4"" wide so I can only hold it on its side, not fully grasp it.  It is, however, a very attractive calculator with an elegant silver case.  Very attractive for a woman's use, or handsome for a man's use.  The keys are very soft and responsive.  The readout is very large and easy to read.  Overall it's a beautiful product, but not terribly functional as a hand-held calculator.",2

"Plantronics T20: 90% PERFECT, 10% DEADLY
This would be the perfect headset phone if not for a few deadly missteps that led me to return it.

Perfect:
--Quality build (solid), the right size, the right features (buttons for mute, hold, redial, conference, and flash, plus volume and tone controls). And the mute has a red indicator so you don't forget (although I'd prefer an indicator that flashed like on the Polycom conference phones).
--Also, high quality sound in the headset - I could hear the other party perfectly, with only a faint background hiss.

Deadly, starting with the most serious:
--The people I talked with said that I sounded distant. It appears that the microphone doesn't come forward far enough to pick up my voice well.
--The headset cord is not shielded and picks up noise from the computer. In particular, I had to be careful to route the cord so that it avoided the keyboard or it picked up a loud tone both parties heard.
--The headset cord is very thin and I worried that a minor mistake (such as catching it in a closing a desk drawer) would seriously damage it.
--There is no headset for the T20 that covers both ears (binaural). I called to verify this. Although the headset jack in the base is physically compatible with the binaural headset from my M12, the headset from the M12 does not work with the T20.

It seems like they could make this the perfect phone just by making a few straightforward engineering changes. But until then...

PS - There was always a low hiss in the headset. In looking into noise-canceling technology, I learned that these systems typically introduce a hiss of their own. In a noisy environment, you don't notice the hiss because the noise the circuitry takes out is much greater than the hiss it adds. But in a quiet environment like mine, there is no benefit to the noise-canceling feature and you hear the hiss. I can't guarantee that this was the source of the hiss I heard, but it seems likely. (There is no way to disable the noise-canceling circuitry.) I don't think the Amazon listing mentions the noise-canceling feature of this phone, but it's on the box.",2
"This came in on the latter(and cheaper) end of the long line of excellent Palm products, and is a very easy to use, ergonimaclly friendly toy. Yes, I said toy because unfortunately it's just too out of date. You can now have as many features on your cellphone as this offers, and even at under $40 - buying something that has only 2MB of memory and is not upgradeable is simply a waste. No offence to Palm, I like their products, and have had several, but please wake up and smell the future! There are now a great many affordable PDA's out there that you can do so much more with, and products like this, however well made have just been left behind. For example, at still under $100 is the  Hewlett Packard Jornada 525 Color Pocket PC - upgradeable and has ten times the power and functions. Save your money, and buy something more modern.",2
"We purchased this type writer and similar models.  They don't last.  Very minimal usage.  They tend to break at somewhere near the daisy wheel.

Like I stated, this machine has been used very minimally.  We probably used it once every two to three months to type some labels.",2
"This machine is your standard, average typewriter. Nothing spectacular about it. It's functional and gets the job done. My only issue with this Brother machine is that on the outside of the carton it came in, it says ""Made of New & Recycle Parts reconditioned from Brother recycled parts"". This stumped me for a little bit before it dawned on me that Brother had somehow ""Frankensteined"" this typewriter from new and old recycled parts. Now from the naked eye, I can't tell what parts are recycled but because they wrote that on the box, I'm thinking that it's true.

I think customers thinking of buying this machine should be aware of this little fact. Brother needs to better disclose this when selling this item because I think that people assume if the word ""refurbished"" or ""used"" is not part of the product description, then they assume it's new. I did and I was wrong. I had to take 1 star away for that.",2
"I love these geoboards for two reasons: (1) they are only 7 inches and (2) the pegs where the rubber bands are placed has a flattened tip so that the rubber bands are less likely to slide off.

The plastic wrapping was broken and as you can tell by the picture, forcibly ripped because it has scratches around the large crack.

I'm sure I can eventually find a few uses indoors for it, time will tell but so far I'm regretting my purchase.",2
Lint magnet,2
Did not work as well as I hoped.,2
Was hard to cut to the right size and then was not sturdy enough to be a small hand towel rack.,2
They don't last very long. This is my 3rd one. I need to buy a heavy duty one that you offer.,2
"I don't know if I received an extremely old batch of this tape or what, but this just didn't work. My husband and I were moving, surrounded by boxes in our apartment living room. As we'd walk around we'd hear the ""scriiiiitch"" of tape unsticking, flapping about in the most embarrassing fashion. We tried double-sticking, triple-sticking tape, covering it each and every way. Unfortunately, we ended up having to use duct tape to re-stick most of the boxes. I can only imagine how frustrating it would have been to pack up all of the boxes, move it into a storage unit, and then rediscover all of your boxes were basically un-taped again.

The worst part of all is that this came with six rolls. We only managed to go through about two rolls for moving day, so we had four rolls left over, taunting us.

But hey, at least unpacking was pretty easy.",2
Sticks very poorly to cardboard boxes. Had to re-enforce with strapping tape.,2
"Cheap feeling, looking.",2
Thin and light.,2
Yuk.  Its purple lavender and not blue.,2
Don't like them........easy peel pretty much means they don't stick.,2
"What a pain to get these label to line up properly!!!  Even with the help and templates from the Avery website, I still ended up with 6 per sheet never lining up right.  I had to give up having a colored background because the misalignment made some labels have a white border.  I ended up removing my colored background and leaving it white to decrease the frustration.  The print quality is poor - my prints came out with a slight blur no matter what.  Okay for casual labels but not if you are using these for a nice occasion.  I won't buy again!",2

"This pad sits much higher than my actual Logitech keyboard, thus making it useless.",2
Does not stick as well as expected,2
"I found that this poster tapes works well on glossy surface, but on flat painted surface, it can take off some of the paint. And depending upon the heat conditions your item has been in, it can take some paper with it when using paper-paper contact.  As long as you realize this possibility and exercise some caution it should be ok, but it is not as ""removable"" as a Post-it, since it does need to hold up some more weight.",2
"Consider the way we used to hang posters with Scotch tape using the old tape donut trick. (Piece of tape rolled into a donut shape.) Why buy this product which gives you only 150"" of a double sided tape for $5.50, when you can get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scotch-Magic-TM-Tape-3105-3-4-inch-x-300-Inches-3-Pack/dp/B0009F3P3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scotch Magic(TM) Tape 3105, 3/4-inch x 300 Inches, 3-Pack</a>&nbsp;for the same price? I don't really see how this tape is any more removable than the Magic Tape. The dispenser is also a bit awkward to use- for one, after tearing a section of tape off, be sure to carefully adhere the tape that remains on the roll to the small edge near the cutting blade or the backing paper will come off and flop around and make that section of tape useless. Second, when you go to tear a piece off, you almost have to hold the roll with one of your thumbs to make sure you don't tear off too much because it's difficult to roll back with the backing paper. You also pretty much need to hold your thumb over top of the tape/and blade when you go to tear it - due to the backing paper, it's too stiff and won't stick to the blade unless you hold it there.

I guess in the end, I just find this to be an unnecessary product that doesn't appear to work any better than the old standby.",2
The packaging said IBM but they can in generic.  Deceiving.,2
"Thinner than most, but very slick on top; the tag on the package states, ""High quality, plastic laminate surface.""  And therein lies the problem.

On the mouse pad I received there is an almost microscopically small but sharp burr all the way around the top edge, which is very irritating to the skin on the bottom of my wrist.  Rubbing the pad edges vigorously against a coarse cloth did not help, perhaps a file will.",2
"It worked well for a number of months, but like many others have said...it fell apart as the seams (which are only glued) came undone.

I guess it is cheap for a reason.",2
Fabric peeled off after a few weeks.  It was cheap so no big deal - I just won't replace it with the same.,2
"This cart jammed after the first few labels printed. Not very pleased, because it ripped the transfer tape & I rolled the end inside of the cart, can't open so can't use the rest of the cart.  Ordered a new cart & awaiting its delivery",2
"Not sure if I didn't insert it right or if the label quality is poor, but the label separates and I'm left with one thin sheet without the printing.",2
Not so sticky..but useful.,2
"This review was rejected originally, though nothing in the review violated any of the review guidelines. Makes me suspect something fishy.

This is a review of the Belkin Standard Mouse Pad.

Pros:
Inexpensive and tracks mouse easily. Surface has a slight roughness, which is good as I don't like smooth mousepads.

Cons:
Top layer started separating after just a week of usage at the office. There's a slight adhesive under the top cloth cover so removing it entirely may make the mouespad unusable.  The attached image shows the top fabric starting to detach.",2
It does the job but it's very cheap product that my son did not like it for his gaming computer so I will have to go buy one for him,2
This is NOT 8.5X10.5.  It is actually the same size as the smaller one.,2
.Lasted little over a month.,2
Too small for anything other than file folders,2
"I have to agree w/others here, not what they used to be.  You have to be very careful or they smudge & at times the ink seems to float away leaving the printed address dull and sometimes unreadable.  In addition I now get smears on the pages and you can no longer print say 14 today and then use the other 16 another day as the unused ones look like *$)_#.  Wish someone made a better alternative and the quality Avery used to have, even at a higher price I'd gladly pay for them.  Maybe Avery can come out with a Professional line and go back to some better materials?",2
As described.,2
"It smells. No seriously, it has an odor to it. It's been sitting out off to the side for about a month now and it still has an odor. I imagine the odor would go away if I started using it, but I don't want to get that smell on my hands... Ugh.

The material is nice enough, so it'd be great if it didn't have this odor",2
"How could a mouse pad go wrong? That's what I asked myself before buying this super cheap mouse pad, but it was basically unusable.",2
Too thin but it was cheap. I will buy a better one.,2
Not as good as cheaper version.  Many issues with printer jamming and labels getting stuck in printer.,2
Okay but would not order again.,2
Doesn't stick very well. Very disappointing. I wound up ordering another brand.,2
"Very nice quality, however it does smell (like plastic) , lol I tried washing it, and drying it out. However it still exists. Hopefully will go away after some use.",2
"This replaces an older belkin from 2007.  This one is very stiff and seems to have foam, not gel.  I purchased a Belkin mousepad/rest at the same time and it is gel.  Disappointed.",2
I had to return this mouse pad because none of my wireless mice would work on the it's surface. I have Logitech MX Master and a Tonor mouse I can't recall the exact name but it has an arch to it.  Some other reviewers mentioned the pad has a certain odor and I concur yet it's not completely overwhelming.,2
Will not work with my Logitech wireless mouse. It will not track accurately. Kind of useless.,2
"Weird shape and feel.
Expensive.
It got returned.",2
Only lasted a couple of weeks until it was warped. Ended up throwing it away fairly soon after getting it.,2
Even though its cheap this product makes it obvious. Would not buy it again.,2
"Some of my dissatisfaction with the cards produced with this paper is likely due to my printer and lack of ability to properly program the type of paper being used, but not all.  These cards have a matte side and a glossy side.  I thought the matte side looked more like the image on my computer screen than the glossy side did.

The Avery web site has a lot of templates you can use if you don't want to design your cards yourself.  That makes it handy if what you need the cards for is represented in the templates.

More than the printing quality, I was unhappy with the way the cards did not separate cleanly.  I got little paper bits on the edges of most of the cards -- the very top and bottom strips on the sheet came off cleanly but the side ones and the strips to separate individual cards did not.

Unless you really cannot afford to have cards professinoally printed, I would not use these for business cards.  However, as cards for an activity or personal use when you don't need the quantity required for professional printing, they work okay.",2
"Unless you have an absolutely top-of-the-line inkjet printer AND are handing these out to people who really just don't care much, i wouldn't recommend them for any 'professional' purpose.

For starters, they don't pop apart as easily as other avery business cards (and even those have rough edges). At first i thought it was just a function of the ink messing with the perforations, so i pulled out an unprinted sheet. Nope, i still can't get the cards out without tearing a few of them.

Second, the edges are rough and the paper is thin. These would never be mistaken for professionally-printed business cards.

Third, if you are using a normal consumer inkjet printer, it'll show in the final product. (I don't hesitate to use my photo printer to print out pictures to have around the house, but if i'm sending it to family, or framing it to go on the wall, i pay the few cents to get it professionally printed. The same standards would apply here.)

Since my kids are still pretty young, and don't notice that the back of a third or so of the cards are peeled up funny, i've been using these to make little games for them - pictures of objects for hide-and-seek, that sort of thing. They're fine for that kind of use.",2
The edges do not snap clean. Also it is not a two-side print which is a shame becasue the print quality is good on the front until you turn it over to a cheap unfisished back.,2
"Note the placing of the Belkin logo. On a full sized keyboard, the area to the right of the logo is where they number pad is. In other words, this indentation is exactly where you want to put your right wrist...but you can't because of the indentation. It's attractive, and the gel is very comfortable (I have the Belkin mouse pad, and I love it), but the design is seriously flawed for a full sized keyboard.",2
"For $2, can't complain too much. Its super plastic, and definitely not premium.",2
Mine turned out gray when I printed black. I wouldn't waste your time with these labels!,2
"Wouldn't recoomend. Not good enough quality, even for the price",2
"Not what I was looking for.  I wanted a fabric surface and this is one of the smooth plastic surface types.  I should have read the description more
carefully.  Oh, well.",2
"This is levels inferior to the 3m version. I have the 3m version at work and the mouse wrist pad as well. I decided to go with this belkin one for home use. You're better off with the 3m faux leather that cleans easily and does not fall apart. This one is splitting underneath and because of the cloth covering, it will absorb anything you happen to spill on it. I'm not a full out slob, but sometimes I do eat at my desk and bam. This records all stains and spills you've had in it's close vicinity. You're better off spending the extra $5 and get the 3m.",2
this is by far the thinnest most annoying mouse pad I have ever purchased. Again- you get what you pay for and this is not what I wanted- it is so think that it hurts my hand and does not even work well with my bluetooth mouse- oh well... back to the drawing board for this,2
"I bought these labels for placing on my craft battles and jars as well as for mailing purposes.  They are not good because they are almost clear so when they are applied you can barely see what is written on them when you put them on. Product description should state that fact, but the picture leads you to think that they are a solid white color which would be more useful.",2
"This tape may work fine for mailing purposes on envelopes (haven't tried it yet), but on cardboard boxes...nope! It peels itself off while the box sits still. I had to move and every time a box was lifted, I had to say, ""Watch the tape. It's not sticking."" The ONLY reason most of the boxes made it is because I had careful movers. This tape is a joke and a waste of time and money. The only reason I don't give it one-star is because I assume it'll work on envelopes. I may change the rating when I try though.",2
I was going to use this on black file folders...but the white print is very difficult to read unless you can get bigger print which is not reasonably possible with the DYMO machine. I will just use the white with black. Disappointing.,2
it does not stick. peel of itself in couple days,2
The tape is probably OK but neither of the two LM160 label makers I bought will not work.,2

"The pad seems of bad quality. The gel inside is thin, and it makes a plastic sound when the hands rest of it.",2
"I've bought rolls of this stuff over the years and something has definitely changed.

I moved a little over a month ago, and found that this tape didn't stick to the boxes very well.  Initially it would stick just ok, then a week later, I'd notice a lot of thte boxes would have the tape coming undone.  I had to double check, because I had older rolls of this tape from a year or two before, and the older stuff felt stickier, and stuck to the same boxes much better.

The price is right, and I'd probably buy it again, but I'm a bit disappointed in the stickiness of this tape...",2
fair,2
"There are indentations for wrists, but they are about 3 inches too far apart to be useful for proper typing. This spacing forces the pad to be aligned with the center of the pad at the space bar. This is bad because the pad does not line up to the keyboard, and wastes room on keyboard trays. You will need to extend the pad about 2 inches to the left of the keyboard. On a standard keyboard you will then have ~ 2 inches of unused space by the numpad. On a 10-keyless, it will extend the keyboard about 2 inches on each side. There is also an annoying crunching sound when touched (probably because the gel insert has some kind of plastic wrapping around it inside). For gaming, it doesn't really matter because you only use WASD and perhaps numpad/arrows, so it can be moved to the right for this task.

The 3m product at 18-19 inches would be better, as it doesn't make noise, has a rubber exterior which is easier to clean, is much softer, and doesn't have any contour.
Would be nice if this was scaled down to work on a 10-keyless setup.

Edit:
I noticed that the bottom seam comes apart (it's just adhesive holding it together), and there is a sort of plastic membrane wrapped around a bunch of white gel/glue like stuff. It doesn't seem too ooze out though. The 3M pads will ooze if there is even a small hole. I'm going to try a foam pad instead, since they can't leak or break down.",2
It broke in the first week we had it.,2
Very cheap. No weight to the pad.,2
"Constantly jams in the 160 label printer.  Each attempt to unjam wastes a bunch of tape.  This 1/4"" width seems to be a problem; the 1/2"" works fine.",2
"be careful, not the best craftsmanship. falls apart after a couple of months.",2
"The labels print very well and look really great.  However, the next day, they have all popped off, or are starting to peel.  Geeeez!  People recommend placing clear tape over the labels!!  Really??  I already had a printer that used paper tape, but the labels peeled after a year or so.
Sorry folks... This is really great idea, but the label material needs some ""stickum"" on the backing to make it useable!!  Please note that I REALLY tried to give this device (and the tape) the benefit of the doubt!  Sorry... NOPE!!",2
"I use these labels with ""Poly Bubble"" mailers to ship items. Twice in the last couple of months I've had items returned because the labels came off at some point during shipping. The mailers I'm using are brand new and have a smooth surface; there is no reason an address label shouldn't stick to them. It's possible these labels work better with paper-based envelopes and mailers, but I no longer trust these labels and am in the process of looking for an alternative.",2
These are just labels and does not justify the cost. There is absolutely nothing special about them. You are pretty much paying for the brand name. I have switched over to the $taples generic brand of labels and save myself about 30% every time. The labels aren't bad but the opportunity cost is just not there.,2
"I expected a lot better quality from this tape. I am in the process of packing for our move here in the next couple weeks and every box I pack, the tape pops up at the ends. This stuff doesn't stick well at all. I am not ""over filling"" the boxes either. Disappointing and annoying. Won't buy again.",2
"How bad can a mouse pad be?  That's what I thought....

First, be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad.  Basically, it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32"" foam pad.  Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads, but a foamy pad.

The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides, and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.

The mouse pad isn't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it.  It is very distracting.

Finally, the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it.  VERY annoying.

This is the WORST mouse pad I've ever used.

The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles, so 2 stars.",2
"I got this for very cheap and well worth it as an add-on item, a few days later the price doubled as most things on Amazon do. Just keep watching the item you might score.",2
came apart at one end already but is still good cushion for my elbows,2
"So far, Dymo-brand tapes have been the least reliable and least useful, as well as the most expensive. Dymo's ""standard"" tapes come with a ""temporary"" adhesive that most users will find useless unless they use their labeler to label paper products like file folders. ""Compatible"" tapes generally have a much stronger adhesive on them.

I have mostly ""compatible"" tape, and a few Dymo brand. Whenever I have had an adhesion or feed problem, the release liner has had ""DYMO"" printed on it. The 1"" tape that came with my printer got thoroughly wrapped around the soft feed roller in the printer -- there appears to be no way to release the roller to let the miswound tape spool off. What a mess! ""Compatible"" tapes have never misfed for me.",2
"I run a photo printing business, I just opened this package today and every single page was bent at the corner. Not just a small bend either, like bent then bent again at the tip. There is no way to unbend them besides cutting the corner off and that won't work for my business. It was a waste of 100 sheets of photo paper.",2
"We can use it, but it's not what I wanted.",2
Ok,2
"Ok for books that stay open by themselves, less than about 2 inches thick.  Works okay as a laptop holder if the laptop is around 5 lb or less.  Page holder clippy things fall off.",2
Already the material is frayed and split open on one end.  Not good quality.,2
"I previously purchased a package of four rolls of this tape and was delighted with it.  I'm moving cross country, and will have boxes to ship via UPS or Fedex.  When I ran out of the four roll package, I ordered two more of these.  They arrived a day or two ago, and today I started to pack up the rest of the stuff and it just doesn't stick like the other rolls did.  This is causing me to use more of the tape, and I'm still not sure how well it will hold by the time I ship the items in about five weeks.

Feel like I got stuck, but not my packages.....",2
Not very happy with this stuff. Doesn't stick to itself or wires well at all. Works fine for sticking to some surfaces. I do like how they are split in the middle so removing the backing is easy.,2
"I have one in red also, I bought both at the same time.

After just a few days of use, the top (colored) layer is separating from the bottom (base) layer.

Belkin usually makes high quality products.

I'm very disappointed in these mouse pads.

I would not recommend them.",2
"This is not the same SCOTCH tape I am used to for packing. This is cheap and stretchy and thin, not the robust tape you might be used to buying at costco or walmart. At least you have to use a ton of it, so it gets used up fast.",2

"I read the reviews but put more weight on the higher star ratings than the lower, I guess, and I was wrong.  And at 25-cents a sheet it's not a very good value, either.  Nowhere is the weight of the paper given, so I'd just assumed it was at least 20#, but it's much thinner than that. It's also a rather dull paper, not ""white"" which is not a big problem just an observation.  I'll use this because it's here, but will probably use standard 24# 11x17 copy paper for most of my printing (posters and such) or buy from a local print shop. This is much too thin to use for handouts, however it will be fine to mount on poster board for school projects.",2
Only could give this product 2 stars.  With the way the pad curves in at the middle provides no support when typing for your left hand.  It's too bad because the pad itself is pretty good.  Not sure what the thinking was to make the pad curve in....,2
"I would rather have a mousepad with a more slippery surface.  It is a good, basic mousepad and very inexpensive.",2
"Flimsy and difficult to use, but you get what you pay for.",2
The labels work fine but now they are an add on item and i can buy them at a local store for the same price. I don't need 25 dollars worth of them and i don't need to buy anything else. I used to buy everything from Amazon but i am re-thinking that decision.,2
"Nice mouse pad but smells horrible.  When you air the mouse pad out, it still smells bad.  The size was off by about an inch.",2
After some time this pad's shape becomes concave. And it is too thick. Just spend extra 1 dollar and get twice better pad. I even stopped using this.,2
"The labels are okay for temporary.  It does not stick as good as the Sony brand.  If you need a permanent sticker, these are not the one to use.  It will loose its stickiness very soon.",2
"I use a wrist support to protect my arms from rough wood on the edge of my desk. I purchased this based on good results from Belkin products. Unfortunately, this product does not measure up. The foam in the rest collapses as soon as you put any weight on it. I bought a matching mouse pad with wrist rest at the same time. The cushion on the mouse pad works fine.",2
This tape is very thin.  I can hardly get it off the roll without it tearing and it tears easily even after it has been placed on whatever I am taping.  I thought it was a good deal but it actually isn't because you have to use 2-3 layers of tape to make sure the item is securely closed.  I wouldn't buy it again.,2
I have been ordering these same labels for months.  The labels aren't as sticky as the ones I received last summer.  I use them to place on glass bottles for my small business.  I always order 6 rolls at a time for my Dymo LabelWriter 450 Twin Turbo.  It is very disappointing and unattractive to have to place a small piece of Scotch tape so the label stays on.  Will be looking at another manufacturer for my next label order.,2
avery software kinda sucks so i couldn't print it up,2
"Labels are great quality.

New directions for printing are cumbersome, require a very persistent user and do nothing to enhance the old downloaded template method.  Be prepared to spend three times the usual amount of time to get your labels ready for your printer. Keep it simple Avery! All you are doing is irritating the rest of us.  Read the comments on the Avery site. Mostly bad. I think Avery is trying to make us use their print services. I probably will go back to the Staples brand if they don't improve the process.",2
"I have used this extensively in packing boxes and shipping, normally I use the smaller roll but this is a ""better value"" or it should be because you get much more tape compared to Scotch's small rolls for the money.  Or DO YOU?

I spend a lot of wasted time trying to pull the tape off the roll and it splits into halves or thirds.  By the time, I locate my razor and scissors (razor to release it from the roll, scissors to cut the long strips that result, the good strip of tape sticks back to the roll!  The process repeats, sometimes 3 or 4 times.

Please don't buy this, your sanity is worth more than the waste in efficiency, tape and savings.  When you realize how much tape you've wasted, it is quite doubtful you saved anything.  While the shorter roll tends to split in halves at times while trying to remove it from the roll, the time, energy and loss of good tape is much less in each category.
Maybe they need to talk to 3M (maker of post-its), because they have managed to make sticky stacked paper not stick to each other when you wish to remove it!

The store brands don't fair much better but at least they are usually less expensive, when you buy them at the dollar stores for price per inch.",2
this would be great if the labeler it goes with worked.  i have tried 4 and have had to send every one back because they are cheaply made and quit working,2
"Wow...Is this stuff suppose to stick on file folders?
Just ordered another roll...this one is less sticky.
Having to literally tape all of the labels on. DISAPPOINTED!",2
I was moving and needed tape for my boxes. This tape is terrible. It would not stick. Moving yourself in a Uhaul you could get away with it but I was having professional movers who had to retape every box I had packed because the tape did not stick. The movers agreed that the tape may have been old.,2
"3M typically makes great tape, but the batch I received worked poorly. We had to use it for a project, not enough time to return. Just didn't stick well to our cardboard shipping boxes. Peeled off by itself in several cases. Waste of time and money.

Solution: forget plastic tape, use reinforced paper tape instead --  a far better product for box sealing. Amazon, B&H Photo, and other quality companies use paper tape for sealing their shipping boxes -- it stands up to abuse, never peels off, and basically does the job at lower cost than plastic.",2
"These labels are sticky and great if you're using it to print shipping labels (full sized). What I do not like about these is that they fold up real bad sometimes even if putting it on a flat surface. Also, ink does not dry well on this paper and comes off easily. Had wasted a good portion of these papers trying to get a good copy of something.",2
"Very hard to fold to make the ""tent."". I mean, really hard to fold.
There is an ""Avery"" embossed logo on the bottom left corner of each tent card. I can't print that section of the card.
Card stock setting (recommended) on my laser printer caused the stock to curl enough to be a problem.",2
We used it but had to put more tape on top.  It did not stick well.  Maybe we got a bad batch beause we usually buy Scotch and it is usually good.,2
"Does not work very well.  The rolls ""stick"" and you need to pull out about a foot of the leader to get them started and throw it away.  I only found this ""solution"" to throw some away on a web site suggesting the rolls have ""been stored too long"".  My concern is if it sits in the label maker over time, I'll have to ""re-throw away"" some more.  Frankly, I'd expect this is it was made in China but this came from Belgium so I had higher expectations from a company doing this for 50 years.",2
Lots of feeding problems on HP printers. Paper is too slick.,2
"I use this tape with a nice 3m tape gun. I've packed and shipped several boxes with it and it usually works fine inside, but try taping something in 50 degree weather and this tape turns horrible. I just finished packing a box outside and I literally went through about 1/3 roll because I had to rip off pieces after they started splitting lengthwise about 8-10 times. Even got my fingers bleeding a bit (just from the tape - not from the tape gun's blade). Will never order this again.",2
First roll worked great.  Second two rolls took some elbow grease to get started and I lost a few inches of tape as a result.,2
"Both cartridges were apparently over-filled (I thought), and would not feed the tape to print it.  The machine could not pull the tape out of the cartridge for some reason.  Eventually, after tugging gently on the tape, I figured there was nothing to lose, so I grabbed and pulled very hard.  Finally, the tape barely began to be pulled from the inside, and after I'd wasted a foot of tape (a full 10% of the entire roll), it was loose enough that the machine could feed it properly.  After that, printing was fine.

When I inspected the cartridges more closely, I saw that the inside of the cartridge is fairly visible from one side, and there is clearly a huge amount of empty space on the inside of the tape area, so it's not a matter of being over-filled.  These are only 10 foot tapes, whereas I  currently have a 23 foot black-on-white cartridge that has exactly the same amount of space inside the cartridge for tape.  With the much longer tape, it simply winds further inside the empty space, leaving less space in the middle of the circular area containing the remaining tape.  For whatever reason, these two cartridges have the tape very tightly pushed up against the outside edge of the circular area containing the tape supply, and the inside end of the tape isn't loosely unwinding itself into the middle to give the tape some slack (like it does with the 23 foot long cartridge).

Bottom line: if you have the same problem of the machine trying to print but nothing comes out, grab the colored portion (not the black character tape underneath it in the cartridge) and pull it as hard as you have to, to get it started.  Once you've pulled it far enough to be able to feel that it's feeding fairly easily, try re-installing the cartridge and it will probably work fine.  It's just sad to have to waste 10% of the entire supply on both cartridges in this package.

ADDED: As a Vine reviewer, I do not see the selling price, and hadn't gone to look at that before the review.  Before this edit, I had rated this a 3-star product because of the wasted tape due to the apparent internal defect in both cartridges.  I have now downgraded it to a 2-star rating after seeing the price.  I already own one of these Dymo label makers, and recently ordered a black-on-white cartridge that is 23 feet long (more than the combined total of these two cartridges).  As with prior cartridges, there were no problems with the tape feeding, unlike these two shorter (10' ""Neon"" cartridges).  Yet the price of the 23' tape is only 54% of these two 10' tapes (20' combined).  There's no way that more than twice as much tape should be half the price of a double-pack of the same tape just because they're using different colors in the plastic.  Yes, the two cartridges cost pennies more than one cartridge package, but they're selling in bulk, thus saving costs there on packaging.

Worse, I just recently ordered (and received) a replacement 23' cartridge because the old one was getting close to empty.  After doing the initial review of this Vine product, I decided to see if it feeds OK.  It does not!  It too had to be pulled out of the cartridge, though not as far as the 10' cartridges, before it would feed automatically during printing.  It appears that Dymo has a manufacturing problem that goes well beyond these new little 10' ""neon"" cartridges.  The problem is now also in the old standard 23' cartridges as well - a fundamental manufacturing issue.",2
Not so good!,2
"I've been using Epson Premium Matte paper for our business for 3 years and have just switched off using this paper because starting last summer (July 2015), our prints would have little white flecks of missing ink on the surface- of course causing us to have to reprint the art. This had never been an issue with this paper before, but since July started happening with all the sizes we use- 8 X 10, 8.5 X 11, 11 X 14. We thought it might be the printer in need of printing- but we use 3 different printers and it was happening on all 3. We did cleanings, switched out all the inks, cleaned and scrubbed the room in case somehow dust was hanging around the printers...nothing worked and this issue was causing us hours of extra work, not to mention hundreds of ruined prints and supplies. Finally, I switched paper to another company and the problem went away instantly. All we can think is that maybe the machine that cuts the paper at the factory has slightly dull blades and it's causing particles on the paper. But it's been doing it since July 2015- and right now it's February 2016, so how long would Epson leave a machine working with dull blades? It's unfortunate because we liked this paper and we go through tons. But unless they fix the issue they are having with particles on the page causing the ink to be missing in spots, then the paper is useless. Sadly, I can no longer recommend this paper.",2
Too expensive,2
"I'm not sure why anyone with a Windows driven computer would want one of these old things. And if you insist on impact printing, I have an old Swintec 8000 typewriter that can be rigged to the computer.

Belkin usually does better quality products. Two of these have already started peeling back after the first week on the desk -- delaminating the cloth from the rubber. A little Super Glue may be needed to keep these operating. Disappointed.,2
The fabric surface on the foam pad doesn't hold up.  The edges curl up wherever my hand lies and it stains easily from coffee and everything else.  It's cheap.,2
Used maybe a month and the cloth cover is already curling up off of the backing.,2

Mouse pad slides around too much doesn't stay in place.,2
I purchased this on March 2. Here it is June 29 and the sides of the top cloth are already peeling away from the pad. It's looking pretty bad next to my desk at work. No quality control at all on these.,2
the top layer separated after 3 months use,2
"I only paid two bucks and it was an ""add on"" item, so I almost feel bad complaining, but this photo is what it looks like after only two weeks of use. The fabric is peeling away from the rubber. I'll probably only get a couple more weeks use out of it before it needs to be thrown away. Guess I'll just go back to what I was doing before and just use the back of my paper notepad.",2
Yep it's a mouse pad nice and thick. (UPDATE) I've had the pad for about a week and while it looks good . The fabric is coming off the pad. I wouldn't buy this again.,2
"I have bought a number of mouse-pads similar in appearance and feel, but this one is different. It literally stinks.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who makes a fuss about plastic or chemical smells, generally.
This smell is aggressively nasty.

Different people have described it in different ways. I think is smells very much like mothballs. Out of a dozen pads, none with an unpleasant odor to speak of, this evil smelling thing comes along. What in the world is Belkin thinking? When I first opened the box, I found the pad in a clear plastic wrapper. As soon as I opened the wrapper the pungent smell of mothballs filled the room. It really IS that bad. What moron chose the rubber or adhesive formula responsible for this?

If the stink goes away fine, but if as some reviewers have stated--that the stink is here to stay--I will have to toss it out.
This is inexcusable. Amazon should discontinue carrying this pad. In effect, it is defective right out of the wrapper.

Seriously folks, I can't imagine another pad having this obnoxious stink. Do yourself a favor and keep looking.
Even now, two hours later I am mindful of a potent mothball smell filling the room. A rotten bad product. Belkin will never see my money again.

A quick update:  It's now the next day and I left the pad outdoors overnight to air it out. It's better now, I suppose I'll keep it. Maybe...",2
didn't work for me,2
"These used to be wonderful.  I've purchased several.  They used to be nice and thick with no smell of rubber.  Well, they're still nice and thick but they're much stiffer now and they absolutely reek of some kind of perfume or air freshener.  On the upside, you can just throw it in the washing machine and then hang it to dry for a few days.  That does help but, seriously, who wants to go through all that for a simple mouse pad?",2
"Yea falls apart right away. I saw some people say that, but I figured well for that price who cares. There is a sort of convenience that one should consider in buying something that you won't have to replace in like 5 months.",2
"Yeah, it's a mouse pad, but the top surface is poorly attached and curled up very quickly.  Better to have one that's all one piece.",2

This phone is so light, picking up the handset causes the base to lift off the bedside table and fall on the floor. Everyone I spoke to said I either sounded like I was in a tunnel or a squealing noise would start up. It was temperamental as that didn't always happen. Sometimes the caller said they heard feedback of what they had just said. Save your money. Buy something else.",2

"I purchased this phone to have available in case of a power outage.  We recently dropped our land line for a Verizon wireless phone connection since our long land line was in such deplorable condition.  It only worked well when the repair fellow came out to investigate.  Anyway the Verizon box worked flawlessly and we were able to plug our old answering machine/phone into it.  But when I tried to substitute the AT&T phone at that same point I could not get a dial tone.  Tried different cables but still no luck.

I might have given it a one star rating for DOA however I am not entirely sure that there is not a computability problem.  I would think that if my other phone worked when connected to the Verizon box this one should also.",2
"I bought this phone because my kids lost my cordless phone and I wanted to teach them a lesson. I rarely used it,  but when I did it was very irritating.

I wouldn't buy this again",2
"This is an extremely cheaply made version of the solid slimline phones they used to sell in the 70's. The opening for the phone cord doesn't line up right and I had to manhandle it to get the cord to plug in.

No matter how I connect the handset to the wireless unit, the phone will not hang up. I didn't send it back because it does what it is supposed to - it works, it just doesn't do what I want it to do and I only paid a few dollars for it.

If you still have a land line and want to have a corded phone in case the power goes out, this will work for you. Just don't expect a high quality phone because this isn't one.",2
"It's okay, but VERY lightweight. If you stretch the cord out even a little, the phone moves because the base is so lightweight. If you can attach the base to the wall or to a table, then great...otherwise, not so great.",2
"I guess I got what I paid for.  I had been hoping that a corded phone would provide the great sound quality i remembered from years ago, when I last had one.  This telephone works in that you can make and receive calls, but the sound quality is not an improvement over my cordless phones.  This is mostly because, if the cord moves at all while one is talking, one hears a static-y ""interference"" type of noise.  People on the other end complain, so they can hear it, too.",2

"UPDATE on November 4th, 2015

The speaker on the handset is dying after mere 8months of very light use.
Ringing works but we hear nothing on the handset most of time, or faint voice
behind constant crackling noise. The problem started about a month ago and
now it's gotten to a point where we have to buy another phone. So, I'm grading
it down from 5stars to 2. I will try to find a similar basic phone but not from AT&T.

Wish me a good luck.

---Original Review Below---
Nothing special but it is a very good basic phone.

You'd say what can go wrong in such a basic plain product. But actually,
not all basic wired phones are same and the least expected can go wrong.

Our old wired phone had really mushy buttons with which you never know if you
correctly pressed the number. Sometimes you skipped a number or you double
dialed the number without knowing. This type phones are hard to listen for dial tone.
So when you dial wrong, you only find out when your call is answered.

Right before this product, I acutally bought a UNIDEN Slimline wired phone from Amazon. because it
The UNIDEN phone had horrendous crackle noise problem (probably I got a defective phone) so I returned it.
But that one also felt very cheap, the base was undesirably light and not stable, the base cord was NOT replaceable
(which I need to do for length) and overall flimsy. So instead of exchanging, I ordered this phone. This one is a bit heavier,
bigger, feels a lot sturdier and overall so much better than the UNIDEN Slimline phone. The buttons feels right and good.
The cord is replaceable if you need to. The base is heavy enough to stay in one place. It looks good enough, the ring sound
is just fine, no complains.

If you are looking for a GOOD, simple, basic wired phone without the Caller ID, I think you'd like this one.",2
Did not work,2
I could not get the phone cord to connect correctly to the hand set which resulted in no dial tone.  I had to request another one and I hope that it would work before then the first.,2
"plain. lightweight. thought it had caller ID. but I must have been confused.. this one has no extra features. just a very basic phone. i want a corded phone for our landline, in case of power outages, but i want CID & CW too.",2
"Alas I have bought SO many of these phones.  My employees somehow break things and complain constantly about how they cannot hear it ring, cant hear people talk etc etc.

However - because they always break things I would rather buy this 5 times at this price than a more expensive phone.",2
I bought two of these and while I could hear people fine they had trouble hearing me.,2
Sound quality is very poor. I had to return this item. You might consider spending a little more and buy a better product,2
"I like the phone but from reviews, I thought I'd get a bell-ringer, not a tweeter. Seller says you could get either based somewhat on chance. Otherwise I say, great phone, as I pack it up for return. IF the tweet vs. ring issue is no problem, this phone is wonderful.",2
Luckily I'm a bit handy with some technical problems but after fixing what was believed to be the only problem (the dial-tone wasn't working and so I had to pop it open and fix a few wires) the ringer wasn't working so I had to donate it to Goodwill and buy a whole new one.,2
"I purchased 4 of these to have around our new house so that I always have a phone nearby (not just a disappearing cordless) but 2 of these seem to often not work. They will ring, but are completely silent. So... they are cheap and basic, but I feel like I paid twice as much since only half of them actually work.",2
Looking for a well-made corded phone is very difficult. Most that I have found are cheaply made. This particular model has a very short cord and does not fit on the wall jack - the receiver does not stay in the cradle. Very disappointed!,2
"Phone works. It's a phone. HOWEVER it will forget the programmed numbers in the directory ""if unplugged for more than half an hour"" according to the instructions so that means that roughly every week, during the regularly unscheduled power outage, it will lose its memory. Lighting storms take out the phone company on a frequent basis so it is a waste of time to program in number. ATT was too cheap to use good non-volital memory.",2
"Great price on the phone, but quality of sound is not good. It still can be used if you main phone broke and you need temporarily to use something else until you purchase a better phone.",2
I bought two items;  one was digital answering machine but phone could not if I return this phone cost shipping not worthy.,2
"Too light as usual.  It falls off the table unless I purchase a longer cord.
I would rather pay more and get a heavier phone for my nightstand.",2
"August 2012. I purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage. They work - meaning they ring - but I get complaints about voice quality on every call. Cost was $9.00 each with free shipping (assuming the order totaled at least $25.00)

Despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted, those statements are simply NOT true. I have two of these phones, both of which are currently wall mounted. As noted in the instructions, you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting. That clip then provides a tab/hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit. This type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that I've ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically. To switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than 5 seconds.

Another bit of confusion. A few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one. That is not true, at least in 2012. The cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will.

Yet despite that mis-information - I'm VERY disappointed with the voice quality. Every time I answer these phones people complain (unsolicited) about the voice quality. A hard wired phone (as opposed to a cordless) should sound great but clearly these phones don't! Your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a Panasonic, at about $30.00.",2
"I like everything about this phone. It is light weight and the buttons are lit and it is simple to operate, but, there is a very noticeable and annoying buzz in the speaker. If it was not for the fact that I will be using it out in the shop where I do not make a lot of calls, I would be sending it right back for a refund. The electronic static should not be present. I tried it in several jacks and the buzz is in the phone, not over the line. I am dissapointed. I know that I did not spend a lot of money, but I do expect AT&T to make a better product or at least have much better quality control at the facility where it was made.",2
"I bought two of these phones based on the reviews.  However, when I used them there was too much static on the line, and the sound was neither clear nor loud.  I ended up buying a GE Caller ID Trimline phone which worked much better for my needs.",2
Go these for my class when costco stopped carrying the papermate pens I normally purchase.  These did not make it through 2 months of use before failing my forth grade class.  I'm going to look for the papermate pens as they tend to make it through most of the school year.,2
"It would be a great pen if the ink didn't move around or explode, it gets expensive and ridiculous.",2
"I intended to give this 2.5 stars, which would be fair because only about 50% of the pens in the box actually worked.",2
It's pens.,2
NOT THE BEST TO WRITE,2
Ink kinda sketchy in dome pens. Not a smooth line. Got these for work where pens always disappear so good enough for the price.,2
These pens are too hard to get the tops off. I won't buy again. terrible product,2
Quality is low,2
they don't last and several of mine fell apart.,2
I am not too pleased on this type of bic pens. The tops were hard to get off of pens. They are not as good as most bic pens that I have used.,2
Cap too tight and pen too slim,2
Half the pens in the box don't work.  I just don't get it.,2
The pen is okay. I should have pick black.,2
ink a little runny and not as smooth as what I have come to know from Bic..Don't like and won't be purchasing again.,2
doesn't write on receipt paper on hard surfaces.,2
"A decent pen for a great price.  No frills.

Great for someone or a business that loses lots of pens.",2
"When I grab a pen to take down a phone number or take down I confirmation number, I want it to work.  Not scribbling furiously to make such a basic action take place.  Colder climate just makes them worse.  The feel on these is also cheap and light.  I was not expecting perfection by any means for this low price.  But they do need to function.",2
"I had to buy a ton of pens for getting petitions signed because I am a canvasser.  These say they write the first time...nope.  Also, two of them leaked big time.  I decided to buy these again since I didn't want to gamble on even cheaper pens that might be worse, and now that the weather is cold, you can't use them outside.  So basically, these pens are only good b/c they're cheap.  That's it.  If you have a job where you work outdoors like a police officer, don't buy these pens.  If you want quality, obviously don't buy these.",2
"This is basically the same issue I had with the black pens by Bic -- the ink is too dull, and the line is too thin.",2
"Unlike past Bic pens, the box I bought recently seems to write very dull lines. Instead of the ink appearing thick and black on the page, it looks like a dull-grey.

I rated it two stars because it writes, but I had expected more from Bic.",2
Tips are hard to get off of pen and some of the tips I could not get off the pen.  The pen writes nicely but not worth it since tips are hard to get off and seem kind of cheap.,2
"While it does write smoothly, its ink does not last long: the color faded away within only 3 days exposure to sunlight.",2
"You get what you pay for.  Cheap is cheap.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  But to hand out to clients that will not return, it's perfect, that was we don't lose our better pens.",2
"My husband was all ""how can tape be SO different from what tape used to be, this is cr*p.""",2
"This tape was for gift wrapping, yet it has a matte finish that mutes wrapping paper and stands out. Wrapping paper should be sticky, yet transparent as possible.",2
It seemed like a good deal for a 3 pack. When they arrived they had barely any tape on each one; very disappointing. Tape worked fine.,2
Cheap and flimsy.  I wouldn't buy it again.,2
"These note books ARE NOT WHAT'S PICTURED.

They are these ""newer"" versions that have a very flimsy back, metal spiral instead of plastic (which I don't like) and just plain look weird.

That being said they are still notebooks and serve their purpose but I will not be buying form this seller again.",2
took ages to come to the point I tried to cancel but eventually did get- flimsy quality- and just an FYI you do not get a color chice if that matters.,2
"I ordered i think 4 70-sheet notebook spirals, and 2 100-sheet sprials from this company that sent me the wrong items from SAM'S club?? But I didn't return the 2 1oo-sheet spirals along with the 4 120-sheet spirls? because 1. I didn't feel like waiting for them any longer when I needed them for school 2. So that i wouldn't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it's okay that my order got wrong. I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened... They are nice notebooks though. Paper quality is a bit thicker than your average thin ..smearable paper if you write with pencil alot (which I don't unless its a math or number involved class)I like them.",2
"I got the m105 and the very expensive portable keyboard so that I could do lots of text entry when I was away from my computer at home, then upload what I'd written later. I was unemployed at the time and didn't want to spend the money on a laptop. I thought I was being clever and thrifty.

Serial connectivity was already on its way out when I bought the m105, but I wasn't worried because my shiny new (bought just before the layoff) no-serial iMac had an IR port, and the m105 was supposed to be able to hotsync via IR. In fact, this turned out to be an iffy procedure at best.

I thought I'd improve my odds of getting a proper hotsync if I bought a serial/USB converter, but I was wrong, and I was out some more money.

Soon, I was unable to hotsync at all, and the m105 started losing its memory every time I had to change the batteries (contrary to what it said in the manual). And believe me, I changed them quickly, but I still lost a LOT of data.

All of this nonsense began shortly after the warranty ran out. I called Palm for advice. They didn't try to troubleshoot the hotsyncing problem, offer to tell me where I could send the device for evaluation, or even recommend a similar model I might like. I was very surprised to read another review here that mentioned a class action lawsuit. I never heard anything about it.

It's too bad, because when this PDA worked, I loved it. If the ability to hotsync, retain data across battery swaps, and receive courteous service from the manufacturer aren't important to you, a used m1xx-series Palm could be a pretty sweet deal, maybe as an organizer for your kids. I certainly won't ever buy a NEW Palm-brand PDA again after the way they treated me; but if you're looking for something cheap, easy to use, and NOT for critical data (appointments you can't afford to miss, etc.), this could be just what you need.",2
"I have owned the Brother HL-1240 Laser Printer about a year now. I have no quarrels with the printer itself, but the cartridges are a real pain.
The first four cartridges I used the 3000-copy cartridge. They ran out really quickly, so I shifted to the TN-560 6000-copy cartridge.
Here is the amount of copies I got on the four 3000-copy cartridges: 2000, 2500, 2500, 1900.
This is the performance I've gotten on the first two TN-560 600-copy cartridges I've used: 4600 and ****2500***!!! For the latter, a black line appeared on the right side of the page after 2500 copies, making the cartridge useless, even though it still had ink.
Tip for getting more copies from these Brother toner cartridges: you can often get an additional 300-500 copies after the red light on the printer starts blinking, indicating you need to change the toner. But it is very irritating having that light blink all the time.
I am trying to figure out who I should complain to about these very poor product.... every single toner cartridge I've bought from them so far vastly under-performs--up to 40%--on the number of copies promised by Brother.",2
Lots of feeding problems on HP printers. Paper is too slick.,2
"Not such an easy calculator to get the hang of, even with the user's guide. I do not like the way it rounds numbers off.  I have a solar TI-31 for the last 15 years that is easier to work with.  Only reason I bought this was apparently it was a requirement to take the state real estate exam.  I would have returned it.",2
"I should have taken more heed of the other reviews stating that the wrong item was received. I too got an HP10bII+ rather than the HP10bII which this item purports to be. So there is no review here, I haven't opened the package, just logged a return request. Ah well...",2
"I bought this model of phone many years ago and was impressed enough to buy second one after the first one got old.  I had problems with the second one pretty much from day one.  Unfortunately, I blamed these multiple intermittent problems (poor sound quality, echoing, feedback, lights going on and off, etc) on our phone system.  By the time I was able to determine the phone was the problem, the warranty had expired.  Now I own a $300 paperweight.

Like many premium brands, I suspect Polycom started to cut corners on quality control.  Maybe I just bought a lemon, but the experience has moved me back to more affordable devices.  My $80 RCA phone works 100% better.",2
"I bought this phone a couple of years ago.  The phone kept getting very hot so I returned it and the new one did the same thing.  I also noticed that the sound quality was not as good as my old AT&T or Panasonic land line phones.  After about a year of using it, I started hearing a lot of static on the line.  Of course, it was out of warranty and they would not help me. I could have gotten it fixed but it was cheaper to buy a new phone.  I noticed that the price has really gone down for this phone.. I wonder why?  Hmmmm could it be a quality problem? Not worth the money.",2
The decimal key died after one month.,2
Wanted larger capacity roll in this type of dispenser.,2
Bought this as an ad on item.  Small roll. not the standard size roll you get at big box store.,2
"It's notebook paper... What can I say? It's ok,and works for my children's school work, but the paper feels cheap and very,  very thin. I probably won't buy this brand again.",2
"I know the quality of everything has deteriorated over the years, and I should be used to it by now, but I was still surprised at how flimsy and thin this paper is. It's too thin to slip into a binder pocket or folder without crumpling up, and for the same reason, I can't put it back in the package if I've pulled out a few too many sheets. Furthermore, if you write on both sides of the paper in ink, too much of the writing from the other side shows through. It's functional, but disappointing.",2
"I am so disappointed in Mead. I know that this is a standard product, not a luxury version. It is just plain old lined paper. But it is such bad paper. It is thin. It has not tooth. The printing of the lines is not consistent. They are darker in some places than others.  It is thin enough that my lefty went through it easily.

This all just makes for an awful writing experience. Basic doesn't have to mean worthless.",2
"Obviously I chose to buy this product at this price- orginally 6.47 Prime price 4.47. It was out of convenience/necessity but never again. The school supplies on Amazon, unlike many of Amazon's other amazing deals are a rip-off.",2
"Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't...but that's on my PC which I bought from DELL who had been trouble shooting this printer since it arrived at my residence. I tried everything to get it to work and allowed Dell Techs 2.5 months to try and solve the problem. I finally said ""enough is enough"". I requested a refund for the cost of the printer and was promptly denied because of the Dell 30 day allotted inspection period policy. As for the Lexmark X83, I'm sure it's a wonderful product on someone else's machine...If you own a Dell, make sure it works properly within 30 days and forget Tech Support.",2
"Despite one very negative review, I took a chance on two boxes, but immediately returned one. Two stars is generous. I tried it on my HP 5650, which model number is NOT among those listed on the box and in marketing material as NOT among those printers for which this paper is optimized. This double negative unwinds this way for me: This paper is worse than lighter, less expensive, generic printer paper. The image quality is no better; the print quality is worse; the heavy weight offsets the advantage of two-sided printing; and the double-glossy paper jambs my printer's feeder. I would be embarrassed to issue a brochure of the quality I was able to produce. I'll revert to generic glossy premium photo paper to display photos and text. The 97 sheets remaining of this foul purchase may end up as packing material.",2

Was well used and dirty.  I returned it :(,2

"Most of the editorial reviews comment this printer as an affordable mid-high quality laser printer, and that is why I purchased it.  After reading a few more reviews and a few hours of testing it, I find that this printer (although affordable) lacks a lot of common sense, and I will definitely return it very soon. I want to give it a 1.5 star (but Amazon have me rounded it up).
Good:
1. Affordable: around $120.00 for a 1200X600 laser printer is a good deal (after a mail-in rebate from somewhere)
2. Support both parallel and USB.  So if you do not have enough USB ports, this is a good feature.  I am using the parallel port connection, and the initiation is delayed notably but it is still acceptable.
3. Power-save mode is very power-saving (I think) because even the lights are turned off.
4. Text is really crispy as long as the characters are black.
5. Printer speed is fast, but that is nothing new for a laser printer.
6. Good watermark feature from driver.
7. Driver has the basic features like selecting paper size, multiple pages (on one page), orientation, number of copies, media type, paper source, resolution (1200X600, 600, or 300 dpi), Toner Save Mode (only for 600 and 300 dpi), watermark, and scaling/rotating/etc.
Bad:
1. Possibly the dullest driver for a 1200X600 laser printer nowadays (except for the watermark and duplex feature).  But beware of the duplex feature.  If the printer accidentally draws 2 sheets at one time, the rest of the papers are wasted.
2. Unable to adjust lightness/darkness for grayscale.  There is an Improve gray printing option which does darken grayscales, but even if you turn it on, the grayscale will still lose details and contrast.  If you do not turn on this option, most of the light-gray colors will simply disappear (become white).  Grayscales in pictures are printed too light.  Mid-tone text printed at 1200X600 is not crispy although darkness seems right.
3. All settings are done at the driver because it lacks an LCD controller.  And because it lacks an LCD controller, error messages are hard to understand.
4. The stupidest feature has got to be the 1200X600 dpi mode (How ironic).  Because the printer has only 2MB memory, you can hardly print any graphics or text/graphics documents in this resolution without any memory expansion.  When it fails to print at a given resolution, it will waste a piece of paper notifying you in different languages.  If you are buying this printer so that you can print at 1200X600, you need to adjust your budget to include the price of the memory upgrade.  As far as I am concerned, this is not a 1200X600 dpi printer.  Including the money of the memory upgrade, you can probably get a better 1200X600 laser printer.  I feel that this is a scam!
5. Because the drum and toner are separated, you will wish that you will never need to replace them (dream on).  Just the drum itself causes more than the printer itself nowadays.  I feel that this is a scam!
6. Loud and long initiation is not good but is bearable.
7. Manual paper feed grabs very harshly on the paper, and if you pull the paper out by force, the paper will likely be damaged.
Conclude: Editorial reviews only review the printer at brand new condition.  I do not know whether this printer will break down or decrease in quality within 6 months or not, but if it does, then it will be time to buy a new printer.  If the drum is worn out or damaged, it will also be time to buy a new printer.  Pictures (bmp, jpg, etc) are printed too light.  This can be a good printer if you are only going to print text (in which 1200X600 or 600 make no difference).",2
"While the printer itself may be relatively cheap, you'll spend so much money on ink that in the long run you'd be better off getting a good laser printer.  It seems to run out of ink after only 15-20 pages.",2
"I bought 3 reams to use with an Epson Artisan 810 and perhaps with an older HP Pro Deskjet. While these papers worked fine (not great) with the Epson all-in-one, but the print quality was horrible on the HP. Texts are fuzzy and overall print quality is not as sharp and vibrant as claimed. I thought maybe a head cleaning would solve the problem but that wasn't the case. I tried some older HP non-premium bright whites and the results are far more superior with much clearer vibrant colors and sharper texts. I've also tested some really old Georgia-Pacific Legal (8.5"" x 14"") standard inkjet papers with the old HP and the text quality also improved compared to the Epson bright whites, and the results also looked better printed with the Epson Artisan printer so this further proofs that these Epson Bright Whites are nothing but overpriced hype. Luckily I got them on sale at a very good price but I will be going back to using HP inkjet papers instead.",2
"There's no reason to order this paper when you can get comparable paper delivered from Staples or Office Depot at a fraction of the price. Also, after making the switch to that generic paper, I've experienced fewer jams on my inkjet printer.",2
"This is a small pocket size calculator keyboard with extra functions - looks bigger than it is.  This is a one finger calculator.

  If you want something closer to a standard sized multiple finger keyboard this isn't it.",2
"The worse thing about this calculator is that the keys feel loose, as if the holes they fit in are too big.  They sort of wiggle when touched.  Even though i'm an experienced ten-keyer, I've made mistakes with this unit because of the loose feel of the keys.  I really should have returned it, but it wasn't worth the hassle.  It has been relegated to the least used calculator.",2
Canon seems to prefer not including commas in their calculator displays.  Commas make it a lot easier to view numbers.,2
"Although the numbers display is ""large"" (relative to the size of the calculator, I did a ""large number calculator"" search on Google), the body of the calculator is dissappointingly small. Easy to hit more than one key at a time. I suppose the dimensions were posted in the ad for the product, but I didn't see them. Otherwise, I probably would have moved on. Does do basic calculations, though. Semi-portable, can fit in a largish pocket.",2
"I searched for ""Large Button Calculator"" and this was the first hit.  It was inexpensive so I didn't think too much about it and ordered it.  I should've checked the size first!  It is only about 4-5 inches wide/tall and the buttons are very small.  If you need a larger calculator for vision or just because you like a larger desk calculator, there is nothing large about this thing!  It's downright petite!  It's fine if you wanted a tiny compact purse calculator or something, but it's crummy for what I need it for, I'll have to buy something else.  I gave it two stars because the display is nice and clear, and the solar/battery backup is good and quick... it's just not what I thought I was getting, which is why I rated it lower.",2
"I bought 3 of these thinking that the size would be adequate for a desk. It isn't. Though it works well, the size of the calculator is much smaller than what is alluded in the Amazon website. Yes, the dimensions were stated. But most calculators are larger...not humongous, just larger. Would not recommend to a friend.",2
We purchased these for school for my son as erasable pens were on the required list. After using them for a week or two he refuses to use again due to spotty ink distribution and the fact that when erasing the eraser destroys the paper. My son struggles with his handwriting as it is and these pens make it MORE difficult for him. I am keeping them to use myself even though they aren't great. Quite disappointed.,2
Pen writes like its running out of ink,2
"These pens are not for everyday writing. They are not smooth and on top of that, the ink really doesn't erase very well.",2
"Sharpies are Sharpies, but in the pack I received, the green was ""dried up"". Not worth the hassle to send back. The rest of the markers worked just fine.",2
Two of the six markers do not work. They are like markers that are so dried out you can't write with them. I bought them for the two bronze markers which unfortunately were the two that did not work. Of course I didn't realize this until after I opened it.,2
Doesn't write very smooth. The ink isn't always clear. Not the quality I remember from the 70s. Buy the Inkjoy pens instead. They are very good for the money.,2
"I usually use Pilot Frixion and those are amazing!  But they cost a little more than I like to spend on pens for school.  I thought this may be a cheaper option.  This is a good deal, but they write inconsistently and erase just so so.  I prefer Frixion, and will go back to paying just a bit more for a far superior quality.",2
"The ink seems dried out.  The erasers work well, but the ink is so dry that it doesn't really matter.",2
"The ink seems dried out.  The erasers work well, but the pens are so dry that it doesn't really matter.",2
tip is thicker than you expect for a fine tip.,2
"I am not sure who is to blame here. I have been using Sharpies forever, but this batch was not a good one. 3 of the pens came dry! I shook them, left them upside down, etc, nothing worked. So I would still get sharpies, but next time I will not buy them online. You never know how long they were sitting in storage.",2
I've used these for a few years and come to detest their unreliability. The ink does NOT flow well at all. Words need o retraced over constantly. I've tossed out many after a few paragraphs. I will try their competition.,2
"The ordering and shipping went well.  Saved money but did not get the same capacity - the first drum only printed 1,000 sheets - a far cry from the 5,000 it is supposed to.  Second drum printing better, but not sure it will reach target goal. Will not buy remanufactured again.",2
Nice colors but don't stick well.,2
"When I installed the cartridge, it only printed in yellow and pink. There was no blue ink. I installed it in 2 different printers (both compatible) and had no luck. I did not receive feedback when attempting to return/exchange this item.",2
Would not work at all in my printer. Seller graciously refunded my money.,2
Didn't work with my computer.,2
"Sure these were top-quality Duracell batteries.  But I felt the seller behaved badly.  The batteries received were old---with only about 6 months left on the stale date.  The packaging was broken and dirty.  I really felt that I received old shelf stock instead of fresh batteries.  And it seemed like forever before they arrived...maybe 10 days.

This buy did not turn out to be a good value.",2
"At the end of my work shift I need to do a bit of paperwork -- in a dark environment (in my car in the middle of the night).  I purchased this so I wouldn't have to use my smartphone for its calculator function.

The good: it works.
The bad: buttons too small, display too dark.
Summary: if you want a tiny little calculator at a cheap price then this one's for you.",2
"not worth the price, cheaply made...It's the same one in Dollar Tree",2
"The calculator works just fine.  However, the case does not.  My case is very hard to open.  Also, the opening is on the left side of the case, when the unit is held face up in my hand.  Maybe it is for left-handed users!?  It is so annoying to use, it will probably be tossed into the trash.  Another China import waste of money for me.",2
There is no punctuation (commas) between numbers.  Poor design.,2
I'll never understand why companies make calculators without punctuation.  It's much harder to read the numbers without commas.  Sharp says that the unit has punctuation.  It doesn't.  The description is deceptive both here and on Sharp's website.,2
"There are better, cheaper alternatives not worth the price..",2
"What can one say about printer paper, it came packaged well works fine and produces well and clear results",2
"I purchased this on the whim and was under the assumption this was similar to other HP paper I've bought before.  Turns out that the quality is no different from other office supply companies selling similar 20 lb paper.  If you want something better, purchase the 32 lb paper...it is the best, but just be prepared to pay almost 3 times the costs of this one.",2
"This paper is sold for the same price on Amazon and local stores (Staples, etc).
However, paper quality is really low for its price point.
There are much better paper out there at the same price, such as Hammermill.",2
"I've had this miserable printer for 3+ years and I've had more than my share of trouble with it.  I've had to buy new print heads which are expensive and hard to find.  I thought H-P incorporated the heads in the cartridge in their other printers--I guess not for this model.

After about a year it had a major brain seizure and went belly-up.  Fortunately, I had gotten a 3-yr extended warranty when I bought it (free--normally I never buy extended warranties), and H-P sent basically a whole new refurb unit.  That's why I give it 2 stars instead of 1.

Print quality is OK.  It does seem to make a lot of unnecessary noise and commotion when you turn it on--but then, so does my Epson.

Software, especially for the Mac, is just awful...huge, bloated, and half the time doesn't work.  I use it only for color copies and faxing, and do all my color printing on an Epson.

I'll never buy another H-P printer.

(Update--since I wrote the earlier part of this review, the d135 totally died.  Since the warranty has expired, it went to the landfill.  Bought a Canon MP780 which I like much better.)",2
"I had an HP Officejet 1170 and gave it awa for this piece of junk! Not only does this All-in-1 have small ink cartridges that seem to run out way before their time...HP also includes an obnoxious popup software to tell you it's time to blow some more money on their bottom line! This feature is unrelenting and leaves me wondering if the cartridges have an internal battery designed to last 30 days regardless of use! Plus, I have never been able to successfully refill these...even the black ink...a great way to mess up the whole device...artfully designed to screw you. In my neck of the woods, adjacent to the second largest city in the USA, no one seems to carry #14 cartridges and when I do find them...what a rip-off! Also, when the fax is used on tone dial, it never works...when HP was made aware of the problem within warantee period...their fix was to have me set it to rotary dial! No repair, no replacement of the disfunctional internal modem...just disable it and go back to 1960's!! What a bunch of crap HP!!! You are theives in the night and I will never buy another HP All-in-1 anything!!!",2
You can't actually see the characters that I'm typing onto the paper. Other than that it works well but will be returning for refund.,2
I'm not a fan of this typewriter. When I type I can't see what I am typing until I start typing on the next row. It ALWAYS feeds the paper in crooked.,2
"Too glossy for me.  Colors ran cause of slick paper.  Epson paper is good, just should have ordered matte",2
Not as good as Cannon paper,2
i'm supposed to lie and say it's wonderful or they won't post it..,2
"I've owned the Toshiba e740 for several months now. I bought it to replace an iPAQ 3670 which needed an external 802.11b PC card to do wireless. (Very bulky.)
The e704 is a reasonable attempt at a self-contained wireless PDA. With built-in 802.11b wireless (switchable in hardware and software to conserve battery life), it is a decent package. Much more compact than my Compaq iPAQ 3670 with an external 802.11b card.
Unfortunately, the reliability is poor. The PDA kept loosing its memory forcing me to reinstall the backup software and restore the applications and PIM information. This was a major pain. Finally, the e740 stopped working all together. Push the power on button and nothing happens. The battery is fully charged, so it must be a failure in the PDA itself.
Guess its back to the iPAQ 3670 for me!",2
Put this in and immediately impressed at how crisp and clean the pages were.  After about 20 pages of printing the cartridge started to make an awful noise every time it printed a page.  My co-workers tell me it's like fingernails on a blackboard.  I used the box it came in to recycle my old cartridge so can't really request to return this.  I'll put up with the noise until I get another cartridge.,2
"I would strongly urge anybody that is considering an Epson printer to be cautious.  Although I certainly do not EXPECT your experience to be the same as mine, as an active consumer I wish to convey my frustrations with Epson care/service/support.

About two years back I had an Epson Stylus Inkjet (forget which model now) that failed while still under warranty.  I mean, the printer FROZE my computer and there were HUNDREDS of crossed out (RED) printer icons all over my screen.  Then I began getting code imposed over my desktop screen with words like ""printer failed"" in the message.  Yes, at the time I had an Apple computer, but that's of lesser relevance...

I called Epson, as my printer was still under warranty for about 8 more weeks.  They said they recognized this sounded bad and wanted me to send the printer in (at my expense, start the tab running $).  I did.  On the same call, they said they could either send me a new printer, or I could- under THE CIRCUMSTANCES I had- go buy one from a local store to have immediately and they'd reimburse me.  I opted to buy locally.  I bought ANOTHER same model while mine was in transit to Epson (tab $ increase).

Then came the true frustration.  Epson spent NEARLY 3 months in ""processing"" my return authorization.  They acknowledged they had received it.  They would NOT reimburse me for a new one.  They claimed that they needed to determine if my printer was failing due to defect or negligence (I included SCREEN SHOTS in the return box of nasty printer icons covering my frozen computer, how can that be negligence?).

After many, many calls to Epson service, they continued to say they could not yet reimburse me.  At one point, they even tried to say that I should NOT have bought one locally as their standard procedure would be to send a warranty replacement from their warehouse.  On this point they quickly withdrew, since I had phone records of who I had talked to.

Needless to say, after several months go by, I was told with finality that:

""Epson would not repair nor replace my printer because it was no longer under warranty.""

Now, I had a relatively NEW printer from them (this one started having printer head alignment problems in the first few months) and they had held my returned inkjet printer from OVER A MONTH from BEFORE my warranty expired.  Now, instead of being out only the original $250 for my original printer, I had patronized a company that had given me difficulty with ANOTHER $300, and also about $20 shipping, and about 50 hours of my time.

I've had a Canon i950 6-color inkjet with borderless printing that I am extremely happy with since then.  Cheers.",2
didn't work,2
"No problem with the base station......But the Handset as others have reported is a a problem. The battery or recharging system appears to be of faulty design. There is no doubt that Panasonic has had a lot of calls re this product...Many people never complain.

I will try the Metal Hydride battery as suggested in one of the posts.

Panasonic is a very good company that makes excellent products....but some don't make it.",2
"DOA (Dead On Arrival)

Still left to be seen if it actually works as advertised but the CR2032 battery that powers this device was DOA. Luckily many devices take the same battery so I had spares on hand. I guess the manufacturer didn't want to spend the money to use an Energizer or Duracell battery and used some cheap knockoff brand that didn't hold up during storage.

Once the battery was replaced, it emits the tones as expected. Now only time will tell.

BTW, this device is installed with the MagicJack USB device so no computer necessary and cheap annual renewal vs. regular monthly phone charges. Phone still works well with device inline with base station.

I'll give it a month and update the review as necessary.",2
"I bought this model in April 2012 to replace a model TZ800B.  I really do believe that telemarketers have gone way beyond what the Telezapper was originally designed to do.  In all honesty, it did not stop that many calls.  My cordless phone allows for Call Blocking and this is way more effective than the Telezapper.  Today, I had to 'retire' my model TZ900.  As it turns out, it somehow was causing problems with my digital telephone service.  Audio would drop in and out during calls.  I had my cable company replace the modem and this seemed to fix the audio problem.  Then, I noticed that I no longer had Caller ID.  Of course, the cable company tried to place the blame for the loss of Caller ID on the cordless phone.  However, I had 2 extra cordless phone sets that I tried to use and Caller ID did not work on any of them. Finally, got the cable company to send out a technician to see what was going on.  When he picked up the phone, he heard the three Telezapper beeps and asked what was causing the beeps.  I told him it was a Telezapper.  He asked me to disconnect the Telezapper.  With the Telezapper no longer in the phone wiring, Caller ID worked as it always had.  He could not fully explain to me why the Telezapper caused the Caller ID problem but he also suspected that it may have been the cause of the audio issue.  Some may say ""Who can trust the cable guy?"" and I would agree except for the fact that Caller ID now works.  I also noticed in the Product Details section on the Amazon site, that the manufacturer has discontinued both of these models.  I also could not find Privacy Technologies on the web and a note says their internet site is for sale.  So, I would not buy either of these products.  Get a phone with a Call Blocker capability.",2
"I can't tell if this thing is working or not. Still getting annoying telemarketing calls, but I think they have decreased a little bit.  Instruction are not too clear.",2
"I never liked this device. For one thing, intruding calls still come through (your phone rings). For another, all it does is attempt to erase your number from the dialing computer's database (there are lots of these computers though!).
In that it might have been successful, but there are two better solutions. For one, you can get ""Privacy Director"" from the phone company. Anyone who calls you from a non-caller ID enabled phone must state their name and you get to hear their recording if they choose to ring through; you can then decide to take their call or not. My own experience with that system has been wonderful, though some friends and relatives whose phones are not caller ID enabled (this problem is becoming more and more uncommon) have griped about it a bit.
An even better option now is to just list your number with the ""do not call"" list mandated by the gov't. Just logon to [...] and list your number(s) there, and soon your phone will stop ringing during dinner.",2
Makes a disturbing beeping noise for all callers including those you want to ring through.  Not sure it stops telemarketers since many still get through.  Claims (after the sale) to only stop electronically dialed telemarketers.  A toss up.,2
"Regular paper, expensive price.",2
"I thought, at first, that this was pretty unremarkable filler paper; it looks pretty typical. Sure, it's on the cheaper end of quality, but notebook paper needs to last through an assignment, not through the years. So I don't mind that the surface isn't exactly smooth or that it feels flimsy. And the paper appears to be a standard size, but it's not; instead of being 8 1/2 x 11, it's only 8 x 10 1/2. Sure, that's labelled on the product and listed in the product description, but who thinks to look at the size when you expect notebook paper to be standard?

But there's an even greater issue with size for me--the huge margins! The left margin is 1 1/2 inches wide, while the right margin is 1 1/4 inch. That leaves only 5 1/4 inches of writing space. It's a ridiculous amount of wasted space, especially since this is college-ruled paper! At a little over 1 1/2 inches, the top margin just further contributes to wastefulness. I imagine that a student could run through this paper pretty quickly and never even have a clue as to why.",2

"I went from a Handspring Visor Platinum to this Clie and now almost regret it.
PROs: screen resolution is twice as sharp and gorgeous, nice sleek metallic casing, Documents To Go is already included allowing you to view and edit Word & Excel files
CONs: screen is hard to read except under bright light so you have to use the backlight more often which burns batteries much faster; the Handspring had much more practical features for business use such as Datebook Plus and Expense Tracker; documentation is incredibly useless so you have to dig around the online website which is only a little less useless so you have to use the 1-800 help number which is OK if you can stand the hold times.
Also, the Clie is loaded with a lot of memory-hogging software that you CANNOT remove---fluffy flaky junk like photo viewers, movie viewers, memory stick drivers, camera and MP3 apps.  (why anybody would WANT to view photos and movies on a MONOCHROME screen escapes me)
I can understand that maybe SOME users will actually use these but why can't those of us who don't want to use them remove it???  ...
I guess that's wy they call this an ""Entertainment Organizer""---probably fine for video games and other fluff but not really geared for the business user.

Most people would find the sound quality alright, but if you are looking for above average sound quality you will not find it in this phone.  I'm quite disappointed.  The rest of the phone's features are fine - no complaints except for the primary reason why I purchased this phone.",2
"It's OK for the price, but beware that there is a BATTERY for the speaker phone; it does not plug into an AC outlet.  The battery seems to need replacement way too often.",2
"LCD display failed, and unit uses a lot of AA batteries.  Does not show time you are on the call.",2
Phone is OK but the speaker phone on all 3 phones I bought does not work properly.,2
"Sorry I bought this. The ring volume's highest level is hardly loud enough to be heard from a 30-foot distance, and the settings for frequently called numbers doesn't function properly. You get what you pay for.",2
"and can't navigate long automated phone systems like to the cable company because the keypad is too light or something to be recognized and it no longer offers good report options like every call made or received like past models - there is just this weekly report that is totally useless.  This SHOULD be our last Japanese machine.,  I am personally boycotting Japanese and German brands and trying to buy American but this was a purchase made by someone else and it isn't worth the replacement toner cartridges for all that it does not do compared to Brother fax machinese we owned twenty and ten years ago.  And so GOES Brand Japan.

"Good sound on the speaker and the handset, a decent microphone, and quality construction earn this two stars, and that's it.

In fact, this phone is a relic, a piece of late 80's hardware stubbornly hanging on in 2011.  It has no caller ID, three AA batteries are required to power the speaker, you have to hand write your stored contacts with eraseable ink, and the coiled cord connecting the hand-set to the base is too short (meaning you have to go out and buy a longer one if you have a typical desk--otherwise you have to keep the base right at your elbow!)

The phone is too big for so few features, taking up too much real estate on the desk for no good reason.

Those three AA batteries, according to the manual, must be replaced every six months; however, I believe the other customers who say the batteries don't last more than three months.  That is ridiculous.  You'll be buying six to twelve or more batteries a year for the life of the phone.

This phone is missing features and will be expensive to keep.  I believe it has very limited appeal.",2
Way too pricey.,2
"My phone works OK until I use a headset, which is unfortunately why I bought it. Then it refuses to hang up completely.  It hangs up, but then gets a dial tone even though I have pressed the headset button to disconnect.  My old ATT phone worked much better.",2
"I got this phone to replace an AT&T phone that has a very poor speaker phone.  Unfortunately this one is not much better.  You have to yell when only three feet away from the phone for the other person to hear you. Also, the max volume on the specker phone is not all that loud. Why can't they make a speaker phone that works that doesn't cost a hundred dollars?  The speaker phone on cell phone work better (much better) than this one.  Maybe they have to plug into an electrical socket to get enough power.  This one runs on three AA cells.",2
I bought this phone twice and both times after several months had problems with it. A phone should be able to last at least 5 years not have problems after 7 months. This time the problem is the speaker phone is not working well. So twice bought and twice had problems within 1 year. How can I recommend this phone?,2
"I've installed this scanner under OS X (download the TWAIN driver, there's none included) and Windows 2000. I've also installed the less expensive Canon LIDE 30 under both environments.
I recommend the LIDE 30 for the reasons described below. In particular the Perfection 1660 has fine hardware, but the most abysmal documentation I've see in years. The installation is awkward and the software is unimpressive. Some of the software is specific to Epson printers, for example. Scan color under OS X has a bluish tinge, though that evaluation is complicated by the lack of Epson documentation on ColorSync settings. When you do a scan the progress box is immovable and sits atop all windows -- so you can't work during a scan. A minor point, but it illustrates how unrefined the Epson software is.
Additional comparison to the CanoScan LIDE 30 (emphasis is on OS X, but much of this is true for Win2K:
1. Image quality (color picture, 300 dpi, 24 bit)
Both seem to produce excellent color photo scans, though on the Mac the EPSON colors were a bit bluish.
CanoScan > Epson
2. Durability and reliability. The EPSON feels more rugged and
durable, as befits it's significantly higher price.
Epson > CanonScan
3. Convenience. The Epson seems to be about 4 times bigger and heavier than the LIDE 30. The LIDE 30 gets its power from the USB bus, the Epson needs yet another power brick (and we have no room to spare!). The LIDE can be stored on its side.
CanoScan >>> Epson.
4. Performance. The CanoScan is at least twice as fast with a USB 1.0 connection, and probably even faster with a 2.0 (though the images I'm taking aren't huge).
Epson >> CanoScan
5. Drivers (OS X). The CanoScan uses a PhotoShop Plug-In compatible with GraphicConverter, Canon's software, and PhotoShop like products), the Epson uses a TWAIN driver. I thought that OS X (in particular) would have native support for the Epson, but in fact this is no advantage. Without installation of the TWAIN driver Image Capture acquires only a very low res image (400K TIFF). After installing the
TWAIN driver Image Capture behaves exactly the same way, but
GraphicConverter will get an image. The image acquisition software seems similar, with the EPSON having the advantage of more control over embedded color tables and ColorSync use; but I'm not sure the ColorSync setting are doing anything! The EPSON is biased however to EPSON's peculiar proprietary color matching software. I didn't pay attention to the rest of the bundled s/w, but I thought the CanoScan had a slight advantage overall. The Epson OS X TWAIN installation should be straightforward, but for some bizarre reason one has to burrow through folders and extractions to fine a nice simple disk image. CanoScan installation was bizarre, but the front buttons work under OS X. The Epson buttons don't work under OS X (not that I would use them anyway!)
CanoScan > Epson
6. Cost. The EPSON is almost twice the cost of the CanoScan.
CanoScan >> EPSON (much better, not more expensive!)
7. Support. The Epson web site is fair. Tech support is by phone or mail. Canon has a very good web site.
CanoScan >> EPSON
8. Documentation. Excellent on the CanoScan, worst I've ever seen for the Epson.
CanoScan >>> Epson.
9. Bundled software. Epson has none for OS X, fair to poor for Mac Classic and Windows. CanoScan is fair for OS X, fair to good for Windows.
CanoScan >> Epson.
8. Other features. The EPSON has a negative scanner that's said to work (I've not tested it).
Epson >> CanoScan",2
"I bought the Epson Perfection 1660 scanner after researching scanners for a while. I was excited to see the initial scans but could not get the one touch buttons to work. Epson Tech support (which is a toll call) said the problem is that I have a Hewlett Packard Printer (which I love and don't want to change). The only way I can copy with the Epson scanner is to have an Epson driver on my system set up as the default printer and then switch the printer on the copy screen to my HP. The problem with this is that, of course, I don't have an Epson printer so I have to 1) change the default settings every time I want to copy something. 2) Change the printer for each copy. And 3) Remember to change the default back after I make the copy. Not exactly one touch. I asked the tech support if they planned to fix this - they said No. I couldn't believe it so I made another toll call and I talked to Customer Service. They basically said - if you don't like it - return the scanner.
I have not exhaustively checked the features because the driver problems are enough to make me return the scanner.",2
"I don't care for this particular inkjet cartridge.  Although it serves the purpose, it runs out of ink quickly and if not used frequently it dries out.  The cost in my opinion is too much for something that a person can go through a carhtridge within less than a week. And if not careful when printing you can smudge your document.",2
"These are high quality labels like the matte ones I usually use, but they are slipping in my inkjet and printing off-center from CD label, so I'm holding off giving more stars for now until I figure out what the problem is. I can't afford to waste a lot of labels experimenting. The print quality appears excellent. The problem may be my printer.",2
"The MS Word template was easy to use. However, these were VERY difficult to separate after printing because the perforations weren't deep enough. Plus, the paper wasn't as thick as I was expecting. My finished business cards looked very DIY and unprofessional.",2
"I have not been very happy with my CD Stomper. I have a difficult time getting the CDs and labels to line up properly. Often, the label overhangs the edge of the CD a little bit. The perforation around the middle of the labels show whether or not I pop the center out. It usually take me two sheets of labels to get one good label, and I waste two or three CDs. You can not remove the label once it's on there, because it peels the foil off the CD.

The labels do look nice and peel off the backing very easily. When it lines up right, the CDs look great.

I chose to use another program to create and edit CD labels. The only template Avery has is in Microsoft Word format, and it did not line up right when I printed it. So I made my own template.

Overall, I found the CD Stomper to be OK, but I would not choose to purchase this again knowing what I know now. Our CDs looked much better and cost less time and effort when I printed directly on to the CD.",2
"I typically like Epson papers and have used their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Premium-Glossy-papers/dp/B00009NDCX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Premium Glossy papers</a>&nbsp;for years. But I don't quite know what to make of this luster paper.  I would like a paper with a little lower reflectivity for prints that are viewed under bright lights.  But this sacrifices too much.  I shoot at high resolution and spend time calibrating monitors and editing photos to get realistic colors.  With this paper, detail goes missing and colors are washed out.  It's possible that the printer profile itself is off, but I use an Epson printer (R800) and there's little excuse for that.  Their profiles for other papers are pretty close.

If you like prints that look like watercolors, then this may be the paper for you.  I think it's going to take me a very long time to get through this pack.",2
"did not work well.

"This looked wonderful when I first saw it, I happen to like the sleek looking modern design (much more in tune with our decorating then the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clear-Solutions-Jumbo-Cookbook-Holder/dp/B0000DE1MV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clear Solutions Jumbo Cookbook Holder</a>&nbsp;cookbook holder I've been using. Yes I said cookbook holder, granted I realize this product is far from being advertised as a cookbook holder but I was hoping for something multipurpose. Cookbook holder, sheet music holder for practice times for my daughter and husband, document holder for my husband or myself, and reference book/sheet holder for our homeschooled daughter as we don't need to use it for all those things at once I hoped this would function well for each as needed.

Upon opening the box I was dumbfounded, I'm a college educated adult who has fixed her own dryer and dishwasher along with assembling lots of furniture in our home and yet I stared at this lost, the directions... well they just aren't. I had to go off of the images here online to get it together and I must still be doing something wrong since I've almost put out my eye, my childs eye, and the dogs eye with the darn elastic strap part... it keeps flying off the device and across the room.

Also I realized this would be big, but you just don't realize how big until it's set up, and heavy. Great for holding down big books but not making it very moving friendly and between the band and weight not something I'd consider using for my original idea of letting our little girl use it for reference books unless we set it up for her. I also find the band annoying, how it could be a line marker is beyond me as it's not quick nor easy to move and it just ends up being in the way of text, leading to trying to pull it out of the way and ZOOOMMM off it goes across the room again ::sighs::

I think I'm going to retire this to our desk for adult use only, making the retail and even amazon price crazy for what it will actually do for us. On a side note the before mentioned cookbook holder that I have is wonderful, lightweight but holds the biggest books with ease, nothing to fling off or put an eye out, and it folds up in seconds to store flat... I highly recommend checking it out if you're looking for something to hold books open (being that it has no real back it wouldn't work well for documents only). I love 3M (could you imagine life w/o sticky notes?) but I think they missed the bar on this one.",2
"When I got this product I realized it was extremely heavy and complex to put together. Not exactly what I thought I would be getting.  Then unpacking I realized it took up a huge footprint on my limited desk space. This thing is just too big for a regular person's desk and more fitting to be in some kind of industrial fabrication plant. Seriously, the design is old and not very useful. It's also severely overpriced.",2
"This product weighs a ton, or at least way more than a document holder made for sheets of paper.  Also, unless your monitor is well above the desk, anything you put in this will block the screen, plus you need room front to back room between your keyboard and monitor.  Buy this only if you have the space and need the holder for heavy items.  For papers (e.g., contracts, homework) use a document holder that is longer top to bottom (or tape the pages one at a time to a top corner of your monitor).",2
"I purchased this keyboard because it fit my keyboard and because it was not too big to fit the space under my desk. Also importantly it appeared light enough to make it easy to install under my desktop. This was important because my past experience is that installing anything under a desk can be difficult if the item is heavy because it then becomes necessary to tip the desk over on its back to make the installation.

But because of poor design, the installation turned out to be more difficult than it should have been. I had planned to take the adhesive pads from 3M wall hooks and affix them to the drawer brackets and then stick the drawer under the desktop, then drill the holes for the screws through the bracket mounting holes. That was stymied because the mounting holes were so close to the vertical arm of the bracket that a drill would not fit vertically so that the holes would be drilled at a slight angle which is not satisfactory. In fact, the hole was so close to the bracket that a power screwdriver couldn't be used.

To solve this problem I prepared a template that had the holes marked on it. To do this, take a piece of poster board, or cardboard (can use one side of the box the tray came in) or a piece of wrapping paper and lay it flat. Then place the assembled tray on the template upside down and mark the holes. Make sure that the front of the template is exactly where the front of the tray will be in relation to the front edge of the desk. Then place three pieces of masking tape on the back and front edges of the template and place it on the underside of the desktop. Then drill the holes and remove the template.

However there are other problems with the tray. The installation instructions are useless. It consists of small drawings which are hard to read and no text. Kensington could easily have printed written instructions on the other side. Kensington could also have provided an installation template.

The sliding rails are not marked as to which goes on the right side or the left side so the installer hasto carefully determine which goes where. After fastening the sliding brackets to the tray the next step is to fasten the hanging brackets to the rail. The first problem is that the installer must place a spacer over the screw and hope it doesnt fall off while attempting to fasten the bracket to the sliding rail. This is certainly an afterthought on the part of the tray designers because without the spacer, the hanging bracket would be screwed in so tightly that it would be bent inward and would be difficult to attach to the underside of the desk. Probably what happened was that this problem was not discovered until all or most of the brackets had already been manufactured. So instead of replacing all of the existing manufactured brackets with brackets that had the spacer molded to the bracket, Kensington just added the spacer.

The next problem is that there is only one screw used to attach the bracket to the sliding rail and the screw only goes into the bracket two centimeters which is awfully short. This is a problem because using only one screw allows the bracket to swivel (making it harder to attach to the underside of the desk) but the screw can easily come lose allowing the tray to flop. So I used Locktite and I put a piece of duct tape over the screw head which keeps the screw in. But what Kensington should have done was use two screws to attach the bracket to the sliding rail and the bracket should have been wider to provide for this. Having a wider bracket would also make for a more stable attachment to the underside of the desk.

Lastly, the tray does not lock when it is out so it is a constant problem keeping it out since it keeps working its way in covering the top keys of the keyboard. My solution was to drill a hole on one side of the tray when the tray is fully out as close to the front of the desk as possilble. Then I took a long screw and screwed a nut on so that when the screw was inserted in the hole the top of the screw came to the top of the desktop. I then tied a piece of heavy thread to the top of the screw and attached the other end of the thread to the desktop with duct tape so when the tray is closed the screw won't be lost.

I have used Kensington products ever since Kensington came on the market and I have never had any complaints about their products but this tray is far below the usual Kensington quality. It would not cost Kensington more that five cents in labor and materials to fix all the problems and make it a good buy for anyone.",2

"I encountered two problems trying to use these labels.  1.  My security software repeatedly blocked opening the Avery template after download and marked it as a potential threat.  (I have encountered this problem with other templates from the Avery website.)  I used the one provided with MS Word.  2.  The paper is very lightweight so when you peel the label from the backing sheet the label curls up - and then cannot be laid down flat to use with the applicator.  The labels that came with CD Stomper in the past were heavier and I had no problem applying them.  I cannot understand the positive comments about this item being easy to apply.  I'll look for heavier weight paper.  Unfortunately, the layout on the old labels I have is different from the template in Word.  Otherwise, I would use them.  I urge caution here.",2

"I purchased this for an elderly relative with movement limited to one hand/arm. I made her a binder full of page protectors holding pictures and cards from loved ones. I chose this item because I could adjust it down for her bible and up for her binder. The good thing is that it is easy to turn the pages.  The problem lies in the adjustable angle in the back.  It does not snap or lock into place. My relative has a shaky arm and often must make several attempts to reach the page to turn it.  Unfortunately, she winds up knocking it over more often that turning the page.",2
"I agree this product doesn't work for books. It's difficult to move the pages due to the bottom lip, the clip is insufficient and both snag pages when turning, its to light, and it's not wide enough for most books. It's reasonable for papers. I miss a line guide. Its best feature is that its adjustable in height and angle. Its okay but there are better products out there but you will probably pay a bit more for them. This was my first holder. I have moved on to others but on occasion still use this one if my space is limited and the work is light.",2
"The product works well and stayed firm, but the smell is horrible and will not go away. It smells like a solvent is leeching out. I was hoping it would go away, but after several weeks my office still smells like someone spilled a bottle of mineral spirits over those old vinyl capes from Star Wars figures.",2
"Disappointed with this product. I've used a number of Avery printables for years, and especially like the clean-edge business cards, rounded-edge business cards, and small tent cards. These are similar in weight, but leave very ragged edges when torn apart. I'm using them for product inserts when shipping, and spend more time smoothing the edges than I do writing my notes to customers. If I don't, the edges make the cards look cheap and poorly made. I definitely won't buy these again, and am just sorry they're already opened and can't be returned. Waste of money.",2
The split apart when you feed them back into the printer to print the opposite side. This ruins one of the two cards.  The middle perforation needs to be stronger.,2
This is the first and only product that Avery has that I did not like. The cards are way to thin for postcard stock that can then be resold. I am a small business looking for a product that is thick enough to resale small quantities of postcards. Found another supplier online that has a little thicker product that I am now using. Part of the problem is the limits of the Laser printer. The printer will only handle a certain thickness of paper. This is on the thin side. This product may work for printing cards to mail in another envelope or not mail at all. But if you are looking for something to standup in the mailing process this is not it.,2

"This board does NOT measure 5 x 3 as advertised. I saw this referenced in some other reviews and was a bit skeptical about the reviews. I questioned how the board could be advertised at one size, and measure a different size. The board does measure 5' wide, but only 34 1/4 inches high (not 36 inches). For most folks, this may be an insignificant difference, but in my case I was covering an area on the wall that needed to be at least 35 inches high. So unfortunately, I had to improvise.

In fairness on another issue, some reviewers question why the manufacturer does not pre-drill the holes on the board for installation. In actuality, having the installer drill the holes provides for greater flexibility in the installation process (for example, if a hole you drilled in a concrete classroom wall was off by a tiny amount, the holes on the board can be adjusted accordingly).

So, I like the product; I am just surprised that the size is misrepresented.",2

"There was at least one reviewer who had indicated the price of this lubricant was reasonable.  I am not sure he calculated its cost which is roughly $87.00 per gallon.  At that price it may be cheaper to never lubricate your shredder and just replace it when it wears out.  I am not advocating that you should not lubricate your shredder, but just plain motor oil will be nearly as good and a lot cheaper considering that you can lubricate many items in your home by using an inexpensive oil can filled with inexpensive motor oil.  Some may want to use a light grade in one can and a heavier grade in another, but you can save yourself a lot of money over the years by not buying ""special purpose"" lubricants when they are not really needed.  Of course you would want to use higher priced synthetic oils like Mobil One in your Ferarri or Mercedes that is required for their warranty, but even that standard for high performance engines is still more than 10 times cheaper than this ""Shredder Oil"".  Decisions on the use of certain types of oil are not going to make or break you, I am just suggesting putting such small decisions into perspective.  Its similar to the example of the guy who buys a new car every two years and trades his old one in, but he will change his engine oil every 3,000 miles because that's what his father told him to do.  The only reason for changing the oil so often is if you are selling your car to your father who will keep it for years.

In conclusion, if it makes you feel better using the ""special $87.00 per gallon shredder oil"" I think you should do so.  But you may want to acknowledge that at least some of your decision is based upon how you feel as opposed to how you think.",2
This product comes in two parts and the parts fail to stay together and the foot rest is not high enough to fit my needs. I cannot give this a good rating cause its not what I expected or needed.,2
The only reason I bought this product is because of the bottle.  I could not find a bottle with a long nozzle in my area.  I'll be refilling the bottle with cheap vegetable oil.  I couldn't even find this product in local office supply stores.  The only thing I could find was a pack of ten sheets of paper impregnated with soybean oil for $9.99.  I left the store in a huff that somebody would even think of charging that kind of money for soybean oil. There is simply no need for it.,2
"This was quite an expensive purchase.  Other than the fact that it is odorless, I am wondering why I can't just use vegetable oil.  That's what this looks like anyhow.",2
This foot rest broke after I used it for 2 weeks.  The pegs that attach to the base simply broke one at a time & this product became unusable.,2
"This does NOT Fitbit standard size file drawers, it isn't wide enough and falls down all the time. Does have nice compartments.",2
"I gave it 2 stars because it does not have a warning label.

I had purchased this at another store and when I first used it I cut too much off the nozzle and spilled some on a trash bag. My cat started licking at it and had to take her to the vet because the bottle does not have any warning stickers. It turns out that the product is mostly vegetable oil and the worse that I would have to watch for is diarrhea in my cat.

The product works really well but it is a danger to pets because of the oil's sweet scent. I'm only buying it again because it works great, is the same price as they other store, and because I now have my shredder protected from my cat. I strongly advise anyone who uses this product to keep their shredder covered if they have pets or something that may be attracted to the oil. Especially if it has an automatic turn on to protect your pet if they put their tongue in your shredder.

Update** I was really upset when I tried writing this review. A better explanation is in my response to a user's comment.",2
"Not very well-made. Plastic.  It would be fine for the purpose if it locked in place. I may have gotten one that didn't work because it wobbles too much to use comfortably, so I'm returning it. I liked the bumpy surface and the size was good. Still overall, it wasn't stable enough to rest my feet on and work.",2
"It has an ugly, industrial look.  Not something we will be hanging in our home.  Maybe in the basement or the garage.  I'm not sure what we were expecting but upon opening the box my wife's reaction was simply that it's too ugly.

Edit: I generally make a point of not reading other reviews when I review a product so as not to prejudice my remarks but after reading some of the other reviews I feel compelled to elaborate on my initial, terse comments.  This ""Fabric Bulletin Board"" is little more than a piece of burlap stapled to a particle board, with a couple of hooks attached.  You could make the entire thing yourself with less than $20 worth of material.",2
There is no thickness to this. Its really hard to put a push pin in.,2
I should have returned it. I went to home depot and bought a 6x6 that works better.,2
"Great for the home use, but would not fit in my Hon Desk drawers at work.",2
"These were given to us at the mercy of our Lord and Savior, the boss, to help with people complaining of back pain and leg pain. They are cheap and the plastic pieces break easily.",2
Should be about 2mm wider at least--the cards won't stay centered,2
Wasnt properly made. Bent out of shape. Still holds things. Just wish it was even,2
"Basically usable.  I only use one pocket because the other two pockets will not stay stuck to each other.  I used the adhesive foam that came with them.  I then used 3M strips.  Nothing works and I barely put anything in the pockets.  Only one pocket works and that's because it's basically screwed to the partition hangers.  Also, when you stick the pockets together, there is barely any room for a folder.  Find something else.",2
"Arrived scuffed and scratched, Not Amazons fault, Rubbermaid packs them in a cheap box with no dividers so they rub against each other . Very disappointing from a big name company like Rubbermaid. Look like they are old instead of brand new.",2
Mostly paper pages in a nice 3-ring binder with only 10 pages.  Once purchased you need to buy more pages.  Quality was fair.,2
"This foot rest is ok. I purchased this elsewere on sale. It is not easy to adjust from low to high, and it does slip out of place a lot. The motion is stiff/unstable and it's noisy. The pivot is nice but it is unstable and therefore not good for your back overall as it is unstable when too much weight is put on it and your muscles have to compensate. It's noisy. the surface is nice for bare feet. I have back and spinal pain and I will be purchasing a better quality foot rest in the near future. Movement is best. I recommend the Swing Chair/aeromotion in combination with a good footrest a movable keyboard tray and a movable mouse tray, which fits on the aeromotion chair. Your knees and hips should be at the same height and parallel to the floor and you should be able to move  and stretch with your back still supported to take weight off the legs/thighs/lower spine. This whole set up is crucial for anyone sitting for long periods at a computer. A really good foot rest is an important component in all of this which this one is not. I used this for a while and it did benefit me, but I should have gotten a better one to begin with.",2
"Okay,

I received this yesterday and I was soooooooooo excited to use it.  I used the adhesive and stuck it to my wooden hutch and put my folders in.

Then I went to sleep.....

In the morning, my stuff was on the floor!  I am not a happy camper right now. I do not want to drill into my hutch which is why I got the pocket with the adhesive.  I am using double sided mounting tape along with the adhesive to see how that holds up.  Will update in 2 weeks.

UPDATE: Did not last two weeks (haha).  I am going to send it back.

And another update:  I used mounting putty to adhere it to my hutch.  It seems to be working so I have canceled my return request.

Update to the update on top of the other update: mounting putty failed. Got command picture hanging strips. So far, so good and it survived 24 hours. Only time will tell.....",2
"I was sure when I ordered this that it was supposed to have a dry-erase surface on the cover, but this was just a pad of 20 huge sticky notes - not what I expected.",2
"Unbreakable? I think not. One of mine arrived broken, and another broke within the month. I had about three files with a total of 20 papers, and it couldn't hold up.",2
"Save yourself time and money and buy the cheapest wall pockets you can find, and then head to WalMart or Lowes and buy some magnetic strips. That's all this is. A basic wall pocket with magnetic strips thrown in the package. For the inflated cost, they wouldn't even stick the magnets on for you and have the thing ready for use. I returned it because it was triple the cost, and for what? My package didn't even contain the magnets. I had to call Rubbermaid and ask what was going on. Big waste of time and money.",2
"Double-sided tape fails where it should be plenty strong enough.  It is a failure of the tape itself -- an adhesive strip is attached to a foam strip.  The adhesive strip comes loose from the foam strip, not where the adhesive is on the wall surface.  This is clearly a product quality issue.

In addition, the bin is not made of the usual clear hard plastic that these types of products are usually made of but rather a softer cloudier version which is easily scratched.  The outer surface was scratched out of the box from shipping.  I would have preferred the usual tougher and clearer plastic which has been standard for bins like these.

This is not the quality you would expect from a Rubbermaid product.",2
"Not Sturdy unless you screw it in to the wall.
Putting one ream of paper on either top shelves causes whole rack to lean.
May be OK for a few papers on each shelf but nothing more unless you fasten the shelf to something.",2
"The metal edging is flimsy, feel like it may break off easily.",2
It came with foam sticky things to stick it to the wall. Those don't hold and it must be screwed into the wall.,2
these bags are hard to separate from the roll hard to find the cut off point,2
i ordered the wrong size bags.will look for the proper size,2
"I originally gave this four stars, but now .... buy the warranty.  Mine has started to jam if I use one end (with smaller paper).  I have kept it lubricated and have not abused it.  I also looked inside and cannot find a problem.",2
Overall... initially were pretty good -- after some time.. have to go with less so.,2
"These are recommended for the shredder I purchased.  The only thing is that these bags are much thinner than the three that came with the shredder.  While they still work well, they seem like they could rip more easily if snagged on something.  Otherwise, the value was very good.",2
The bags were returned because they were too small & flimsy.,2
"Good design but the shelves are compressed dyed paper & rather flimsy; easy to move, as there's nothing holding them firmly in place. The top & bottom are not solid wood, but plastic film covered compressed wood or paper pulp. Screws easy to cross-thread but go in easy if you are careful. A good bit of pulp/paper dye &\or glue-binder off-gassing once out of box.",2
"Reviews were right - paper thin, tear easily",2
"12 out of the 25 were missing the prongs, making them worthless. So far I'm not as impressed with this system...
Cost me less than $4 to go to office depot and have them cut binding off a book, add a sturdy back and clear front, and speak bind it.
This has been very expensive and so far, not as helpful.",2
"The reason I don't really like these bags is they are nothing at all like the ones that came with my shredder. The ones that came with my shredder were thick, sturdy and puncture resistant. These replacement bag are thin and tear easily and I end up using 2 at a time. I do not recommend them but I'm not sure I have a choice, but I will high and low for a better alternative before repurchasing these particular replacement bag. I wish I understood why the replacement bag aren't the same as the originals.",2
This is a tiny small sticky note holder....not a desk tray at all......looks large in the photo but is small,2
"This looks nice until it falls apart.  The front panel came off after 6 months. We were disappointed. Also be warned that we ordered several pieces in this set and they didn't all come as the same color.  Close, but obviously not the same.",2
I have used this product and a similar package from 3M...the Swingline product does not perform as well as the product from 3M and the results were poor compared to the 3M pouch. Results were not as clear and hazy in one spot.,2
"An online video about office organization featured this organizer by Rubbermaid and got me very excited about it.  So I ordered two for my home-office needs.  Unfortunately, both arrived damaged by assorted scrapes and scratches.  Most of the damages were on the sides at the top, so I couldn't ignore them or hide them from view.  The outside boxes and packing materials were in great shape, indicating these organizers had been damaged at the factory before being boxed (or maybe while being boxed there) for shipment.  So I had to return these organizers for a refund.
Other than Rubbermaid's factory problem(s) uglifying these organizers, they are terrific in terms of design, sturdiness and function--especially because files won't slip through the sides of the organizer.  This is why I gave it two stars instead of only one.
Hopefully Rubbermaid can resolve the problem soon, because this organizer could benefit many offices greatly.",2
Assumed this came with back but does not. Used it to hold Melissa and Doug magnetic pieces by magnetic board. Great for kids to see what is inside but pieces slide thru the back and get stuck behind magnetic board. Good size but would work for my purpose if had a back.,2
"After months of searching for a decent shredder, I purchased the Fellowes Crosscut (I think it was the SB-99?)from Amazon. Amazon said it would take 2-3 weeks and after waiting for about 1 month and a half, they said they couldn't secure a unit for me. Did some more research and ended up ordering a MS-460ci from Staples. What a shredder! The bags that came with the unit were nice and thick and it fit over the shredder waste basket nicely and with ample room.

After I ran out of the samples, I purchased this item from Amazon thinking it would be the same. I read the reviews right after purchasing and noticed that most complained about the quality. I really had no idea it would be this bad. As soon as I opened the package, I noticed that the bags were tied (or stuck together) on the bottom, shorter than the original sample bags and it was downright thin. Pulling the bag over the waste basket was a chore. I had to stretch the bag a little and it fits barely. Then I ran in to a problem. The waste basket open warning light came on as the bag forced the basket to not close all the way.

After shoving the waste basket in to the unit, it still came out twice more after that. I jammed it in with more force (not so much to break the unit... it is expensive :>) The force must have stretched the bag a little more and now it stays shut. I have no more issues afterward. Whenever I change bags, I stretch it a little more than normal so that it fits the basket with ample room. This allows the waste basket to close and shut in to the unit itself. I would give 5 stars if this bag was the same exact model as the one supplied with the unit, but the quality is very bad as I explained above.

PROS:
+Fellowes Brand. (it is OEM after all)
+They do the job (even though they are not like the ones shipped with unit)

CONS:
-Bad quality
-Extremely thin and short
-Does not fit the shredder right (well my model at least)
-Gives Fellowes a bad name (their shredders are amazing though)

Hopefully Fellowes listens to their customers and changes these bags to the ones that they supply with the unit. If so, then I will definitely buy those in a heart beat.",2
This paperclip holder is everything I expected except for the magnet.  The darn thing will only hold one jumbo paperclip at a time.  I would NOT recommend this product if you are looking for functionality.,2
Gone are the days when a Rolodex was a quality product. Cheap Made-In-China ____ (you fill in the blank). Flimsy rollers and cards so thin that after limited use will fall right out.,2
Original organizer was missing hardware and looked like it had been opened. Amazon was very prompt in sending replacement. This organizer is very large and relatively heavy. Ass'y is fairly good. Make sure you have substantial room for product. Make sure carton is sealed. Amazon did stand behind merchandise and paid for return of defective unit.,2
"this came bent and just warped looking. When siting on a desk it takes up waaay too much space, but I suppose mounted on a wall it would be more useful. I just seems so large, bulky and not very convenient.",2
Unless you have a sturdy hand can be a bit tricky to manipulate.  I wanted to laminate a card for my wallet and when I tried the card wrinkled and I was not able to straighten it without tearing it.  But if you are careful this is a good product.,2
Certainly not like the Rolodexes I used to use... not too sturdy. The knob keeps falling off. It does work thougH.,2
To cards keep failing out,2
the plastic that hold the cards come out very quickly if you turn them fast,2
"My fault, I received this and then got sick, anyway...too late to send back. It's way too light weight, I think if you could attach it permanently to a work surface it would work, but it's so light, it moves all over the place! With ONE sheet of paper.
So beware, if you need something you'll only use now and then...it might be okay.",2
"This product is fine, but it is bigger than I thought it was and it doesn't fit where I think it should fit.",2
"The thin rectangular space in the back is kind of useless. I thought it would go down to the bottom of the case so I could put a pad of paper in it, but it's not.",2
"Good quality BUT the central little drawer flies out, as there is nothing to stop it.
The metal is a heavy enough gauge that the weight of the drawer makes it a hazard. I'm using it but can't really recommend it based on the nuisance of having to pick things up from the floor if I forget this, or one of my kids goes to borrow something from the caddy and the drawer become a torpedo :(",2
nice,2
Dodge this one as the inserts are flimsy and fall out,2
"The grids seem to be off because any time I cut, it never comes out straight. Also, if you cut longer paper, it doesn't seem to cut the part closest to the handle. Really frustrating.",2
This is an okay product. Not so great. Very cheap looking and mine looks aged. The paper is blank and thin like 20lb - 24lb copy paper. You have to write down the info on this blank card....The card tray part is just attached to the base mesh tray with a piece of double side tape. It looks so poorly. I guess I'll use this one until I wanna buy a better one.,2
Not very strong and spring out of shape quite easily.,2
"Since it has the paper holder you'd think this is pretty big right. When I opened the shipping box I could not believe how small it is. It is 5x5"" square.
Amazons fake reviews are out of control and should not be allowed. If this has any positives they have to be fake.",2
"it is too big and flimsy. Won't stay open to card I wanted to read without falling over and out of sight. Very flimsy cards. If you take cards out, then chances are it won't stay in well anymore. They will sometimes flip out as you turn spindle to find card you want. I have put this away and gone back to my long tray rolodex file cabinet.",2
"it was sent back due to poor quality , it was damaged",2
"The item looks great and has great styling but the flimsy cards are really cheap and thin. Additionally, the cards don't flip and separate the way they do on the larger models with thicker cards. I think you are better off with a box style",2
"I've had this paper cutter for well over eight months now. At first, I was happy with the job it did for the price. But soon I realized that it was cutting crooked. It's took me a while to figure out it was the cutter. I was going crazy trying to figure out why my cards were off.

The more pieces of paper you have, the worse it is. I honestly can't cut more than one sheet of card stock without it sticking a bit.

I say, use your money towards a better cutter.",2
"It doesn't cut the best, especially towards the last half of the board. It tends to instead fold the paper and crease it. Pretty disappointing.",2
"This is a lightweight plastic cutter.  The good news is that it is crazy sharp.  If you are cutting just one page, it does a fine job.  It relies on a sharp, thin blade, not a robust one like you are used to from office-style paper cutters.

The thing is, I bought this (well, asked for it for my birthday) because I got tired of the lightweight rotary blade cutters that are always breaking because they are so flimsy.  Those don't even have a tendency to pull the page and cut crookedly.  But I wanted something that would last a little while.

This cutter worked perfectly for the first 5 times or so.  Then I tried to cut a very small stack of pages.  5 or 6 maybe?  Well below the 10 it is supposedly rated for.  Half way through the cut it got stuck.  I pulled it out and then tried cutting single pages and it won't cut any more.  The blade developed a nick or bend or something and it will only close half way down.  The thing is permanently broken because of cutting what really was not a large stack of pages.  I think you can replace these blades, but it's clear that I'm looking for a more robust and capable tool than this is.

If you want to do very light cutting, get a rotary-style cutter.  They are cheaper and work better.  If you want something more robust than a cheap rotary cutter, get a real guillotine paper cutter.  This kind of works for a certain type of application, but I can't think of anyone for whom this is the right product.",2
Nice look and easy to use!!,2
"it looks great in picture and i am sure if the maker can put more effort on the product, it could be very elegant in the office desk.
but the one i received has a crooked logo on it. i mean come on, it's your product, you can't put your logo straight?",2
"This item is exactly as pictured. Unfortunately, the Rolodex logo is hot-glued onto the mesh. It was not attached fully and there was hot glue residue all over the item surrounding the logo. I purchased a non-branded version of this item that I am extremely happy with. It appears that, for this item at least, the Rolodex name does not mean good Quality Control.",2
"Item showed up with the Rolodex logo hot-glued on. There was hot glue residue all over the area where the logo was attached. Since I purchased this item for use in the workplace, I promptly returned it. If you do not care about it looking perfect, this would be an awesome item. It is slightly different than other organizers available on Amazon and I do like the design better. Unfortunately, as I said, the logo was messed up. This wasn't something that happened in shipping, it was poor QC from whoever manufactures it.",2
"Flimsy.  The plastic hinges and the binding mechanism isn't what I expected or wanted.  Find an alternative, please.",2
These didn't stack well at all. I kept them for 2 or 3 weeks before tossing them for their plastic counter parts after they kept falling over and dumping their contents all over my desk. Stay away.,2
"Too light. Works fine, but blade causes base to lift as lightweight plastic base. Wood (heavier) base would better suit my needs.",2
"We used this for less than a month and it quit working.  If I can't get it going again, I will be returning it.",2
Bent funny,2
There are better ones out there. It doesn't cut anything thick.,2
"Decent design. However, the one I received was uneven and wobbled at first whenever anything was placed in it. I bent the support bar underneath to even it out. I'm glad I didn't pay more than I did for it. Overall, it is still functional though.",2
"I chose to return this paper cutter. At first I was very excited about how sturdy it was, but then other things came to my attention... First of all, it does not cut straight. I was using this for cutting greeting cards and it was giving them weird angles. Second, it has two sets of measurement, which sounds cool, but ends up being really confusing. If you look at the top half, its cm. The bottom half is in. Made it awkward when measuring to cut. In the end, I returned it.",2
"i don't recommend it , very flimsy and not a pro",2
"I would give it a 2.5 if I could. The blade itself always did what I needed, but the top plastic edge is actually slightly curved meaning you cannot put the paper against it to hold it steady - you HAVE to hold it against the grid marking, or your papers will all be cut with a slight angle. I added a small piece of clear plastic along the top to make a straight edge where I could still see the measurements, however it was still not perfect and I am a perfectionist. I made 200 save the dates and just as many wedding invitations with this - and the slight differences between layers drove me nuts! I ended up evening out the layers with a razor. However, the blade continued to do well after cutting thousands of cuts of heavy cardstock, so if you don't need perfectly straight edges this is a good quality blade.",2
Bought this to coral my Bobby pins in the bathroom. Once you separate the top and bottom it never goes back on right - there's a gap and I see it now in the product picture. Kinda cheap.,2
I bought it a while back but it's worthless and I would not buy again.  It's good for a few months then its prone to break.,2
I ordered a whole desk set of stuff like this.  Every other piece is fine but the card holder is warped a bit so cards sit kind of diagonally.  It's a minor point but annoying to see every day.,2
Wish these were a little more flashy and or a little more durable not entirely a fan.,2
"I accidentally bought manila folders without the fasteners and tried to save some money by purchasing these. I have not had good experience with them actually sticking to the folders. They hold the papers together and are very easy use, they just don't stick well. I should have just bought new folders.",2
Not expecting much from paper clips these days but at lest these are clean and free of burrs. Not as heavy weight as older paper clips,2
Just way to small,2
"bought this because it claimed it was ""anti-dust"" which i interpreted as dust-free...nope...creates lots of chalk dust...and the pieces break really easily...the search for good chalk continues",2
"Doesn't cut clean.  Very difficult to get a straight cut and as a crafter of cards, a straight cut is key.",2
The straight edge guide at the top of the board was not straight. It caused cuts to be cut irregular rather than straight.  Had to return.,2
"I purchased this to replace a cheaper plastic trimmer where the blade went dull after 6 months.  Based on the reviews and brand I had high hopes for this trimmer but it's a pretty big disappointment.  I used it to trim photos and I've found that the photo paper tends to move away from the blade as its cutting.  This means a border-less photo ends up with some white that shouldn't be there and you have to shave more off the edge to get rid of it.  On my first day using this thing right out of the box I cut 10 photos and this problem occurred 9 times.  I've never had this type of problem with a trimmer before and never had this happen once with the cheap plastic one that I replaced.  The blade seems plenty sharp--it's able to shave off a small amount from the edge when I recut to get rid of the unwanted white but I shouldn't have to cut the same edge more than once in the first place.  There's some sort of design flaw with this thing, possibly involving the safety bar which keeps your fingers so far away from the blade that there's too much give when the paper is being cut.  If you're using this for office functions it might be OK but if you're going to buy it to trim photos I would think twice.  Some people might think this must be a high quality product since it includes a 10 year warranty.  Think again.  That warranty EXCLUDES THE BLADE, which, realistically, is probably the only part of the trimmer that you would ever need the warranty for.  I guess if the base spontaneously cracks you're covered but otherwise the warranty is basically a worthless marketing ploy.

Added 02/18: After using this thing for nearly three weeks I'm disappointed to say I like it less and less.  So far I haven't had a single photograph that this thing has cut cleanly on all four sides.  Not one.  I may be purchasing yet another trimmer in the near future and I strongly encourage people to stay away from this one if they plan on using it to trim photos rather than cut documents.  This is a very bad photo trimmer.",2
This is a small stop I needed a large stop.,2
"It's ok if you want to trim off some excess.  But you have to hold the paper very still or the blade will pull it toward the end of the cut.  There is no guide, so cutting multiple pieces can be time consuming.

I'm really disappointed in that if I cut a sheet in half and truly want to use both pieces, it partially bends the piece of paper to the right of the blade.  I don't like that at all.",2
"They came in bent. So when you place it down on the desk they are not aligned or straight. I bought two, both have the same problem. Also, I use it in my office and my manila folders do bend over by the end of the day. I think it needs to be a lot smaller between the spaces.",2
"I like the softer rubber, but did not notice the thicker edge where it meets the door. It is really a bit high to easily fit under the doors in our house.",2
"I've been using this stamp pad for less than a month and it's almost dry.  It seemed a bit under inked initially, but I was able to use it and get an even stamp from it.  However, now, I have to press extremely hard and work the stamp back and forth just to get it inked.  Disappointed since I've only used it a couple of times and need to purchase ink or a new pad.",2
Pad comes uninked. That is not stated in the ad.,2
"I purchased 2 of these. Mistake. They are too short to hold most doors open - the door closes right over the door stop. I have several other door stops and these are by far shorter than all of them. Not worth returning, but maybe I can prevent someone else from buying a useless piece of plastic.",2
There's no pink.  Why buy a set of colored pencils with no pink?  Just don't get it.  The white are pretty much useless.  I throw them in the trash and then I have to buy pink.  Kinda silly if you ask me.,2
NO MOVEABLE GUIDE FOR WIDTH,2
"The racks on this item do not stand straight, they sort of lean to the side. While it does hold the papers and files I had hoped it would, I am disappointed in the equality.",2
Good ink but dries out quickly.,2
"This pad has its issues in the that pad itself is glued in unevenly which makes it difficult to get the ink evenly on the stamp.

In the future I think I will stay with foam stamps.",2
Okay if you use them within a year. After that they become dry and brittle and break easily. If they are actually being used to hold something they fail even more quickly.,2
The product was leaking all over the place upon opening package.  I couldn't help getting my hands covered in blue ink trying to clean up the plastic holder.  I think others have had a similar experience.,2
"Clearly not made in a quality process. The front looks fine, but on the back there is a Rolodex logo glued on, and it is not well done. The logo is crooked and there is glue visible on and around the logo. Completely takes away the professional look.",2
"When I first got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swingline-ClassicCut-Lite-15-Inch-Guillotine-Trimmer/dp/B00006IATI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swingline ClassicCut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmer</a>&nbsp;a couple years ago, I was pretty happy with it.  I used it mostly for cutting coupons and various craft projects, nothing really over the top.

Unfortunately, the product is not very durable for the long run.  There are also some safety issues with this product.  In use, the unit would lift off the table during cutting.  Considering how razor sharp the blade is, this could lead to a serious problem.  While I appreciate that this product is lightweight and ultra-portable, this seems to be a contributing factor to this problem.  The product also lacks the ability to adjust the edge, thus you may have a harder time getting uniform cuts most of the time. Sometimes the cuts can look uneven and really sloppy.

Being made of plastic, the unit has worn over time and I've started to see cracks in the workmanship.  It would have been nicer to see this product made from something more durable like metal.  It doesn't happen to often, but sometimes the unit snags the paper and rips it.  This is mostly in the middle but doesn't happen too often.  For a long term investment, I would not recommend this cutter.",2
OK except that it doesn't have a paper stopper so that you can make multiple cuts the same size.,2
"Dont sneeze on this bubble wrap, because you will burst the bubbles. It's hard to even unroll it without busting most of the bubbles. I got duck brand last time. Much better.",2
Cards are too flimsy and don't stay in holder very well.,2
The cards don't stay in the holder very well and they are flimsy.,2
"just too small and difficult to use.  cannot attach business cards, etc.  just a bit too old school for me.  I kept it and used the alphabetical dividers to put into another card holder (actually just ended up using an organizer tray and put the cards in it )",2
Letter tabs do not stick out above the cards filed - can't see the letters well. A waste of my money - not worth the cost of returning. Do not buy this crap!,2
"Pretty much worthless, poor design.  The center drawer just pops out and drops off.  Not too functional except for the pencil holder section.",2
"The front drawer is missing, otherwise it looks like it would suit my needs perfectly. Once this is remedied, I would probably give it five stars.",2
Cards are thin and rip/bend easily. I wouldn't recommend. Business cads are generally too big to attach and still see tabs.,2
"I expected this to be flimsy, but it's A LOT flimsier than I had anticipated. Next time would spend a little extra on something that will last.",2
"It's not what I would expect out of Rolodex, supplied cards are flimsy, it just doesn't have that firm fluid feeling of and index card file. Fragile, handle with care.",2
"This model breaks very easily. Used it for work, ended up buying so many. We switched back to the other kind instead, the longer looking puncher.",2
"Great concept, but the drawer is way too loose and falls out and everything in it ends up on the floor.  Otherwise, it's nice.",2
I did not notice that the tabs were marked with letters. I would not have bought them if I did. I wanted tabs that you could mark however you wanted.,2
"I have not been able to make the template for this item to print properly. I have wasted a lot of time. I also attempted to use special application for Microsoft Word without success. I may try again when I have a lot of extra time on my hands.

In the past I have successful and pleased with other Avery products.",2
"These are cheap, and starting to launch the wires after a few uses",2
"does the job for a while, but it's plastic and can't stay sharp like metal",2
"If you are using this to just label boxes or items its ok. But, if you are using it for crafting or art journals it is not that great. The letters are a bit small and spaced far apart and the embossing is a bit unclear. The old ones embossed better because the letters were bigger and the tape was thicker. Others have already posted pictures that are very accurate. This is one case where the older versions are better.",2
Was okay.  To hard to make it work.  Will not reorder.  I lost one that I loved and can not find a replacement for the one I really want.,2
"I use a Rolodex as a back-up, and also for information I wouldn't want made public if my BlackBerry was lost or stolen.  My old Rolodex was over 20 years old and still performing when it was damaged during a move.  This looked like a good replacement, but it's an example of the crap coming out of China.  The paper cards are not even half the thickness of the previous ones.  In less than a year, they are already wrinkled.  The mechanism for opening and closing the lid is also cheaply made. The only improvement over the old model is the alphabet dividers, which are plastic and more durable than the previous paper ones.  I paid for the Rolodex name (and inherent quality), but I didn't get it.  If I hadn't left it in the box for three months before setting it up, I would have returned it.",2
"Ok, first of all I get it - it's a label maker and a pretty low priced one so it's not going to be 'high tech/high quality'. But (showing my age here) the cheap old-school, simple, less-plastic-used-to-make-the-thing, not-so-pretty label makers of yore at least put sufficient pressure on the tape so as to form a nice crisp letter. This one does not. The letters have a white haze around them and the letters themselves aren't embossed enough to stand out from that stretched-tape haze.  Yes you can read a word, but why bother putting out a label maker that doesn't make that word stand out?
Probably worse than the quality of embossing is the horrible letter spacing - the spacing between letters would suffice as a space between entire words.  So you have W O R D S instead of WORDS. (Spaced farther than shown as comments parses extra spaces.) Pretty much this means that you'll be going through tape twice as fast - not quite economical as the $9.95 price would lead to believe.
But, it's usable and a hassle to return, so the kid will use it.",2
"This is not a high quality product. I can't count the number of them that have shot one wire clip flying thru the air when I'm trying to secure a couples sheets of papers.

I'm going back the black ones that have been tried and true for decades.",2
"Tried this for the first time.  I didn't care for this assortment.  Some of the sizes were smaller than I felt I could use.  I think other people may find the smaller binder clips useful, but it was not for our purposes.",2
A waste of 9:00 bucks...,2
"Item is no where near the quality of my older 1/2"" tape unit. This one skips embossing, tape doesn't advance consistently. It just feels cheap!!",2
Not what I wanted. Print too small .,2
I did not get any assorted sizes only the mini ones. I had to make do with that. The quality also is not that great since some broke under pressure.,2
Disappointed,2
"The tab pages are sturdy and well made, but the tab pages are the same width as the sheet protectors I use, so the tabs don't stick out. I was looking for tabs that would be easy to see to separate sections, but I can't see them. The tab pages should be wider by at least 1/4 inch or more so they can be seen.",2
Wasn't really happy with these. I didn't like the tabs as once I wrote on them it was clumped together,2
"You can't even see the tabs, they're not as long as the paper. Kind of pointless.",2
"Be careful when ordering.  I searched specifically for dividers with pockets.  Four options came up - 2 with one pack and 2 with multiple packs.  I chose the larger size because I needed 12 and not just 8.  What I failed to see was that the larger option didn't have pockets.

Different items should be listed separately, not together.  Dividers with pockets are NOT the same as dividers without.",2
"I have had this for about 2 years with infrequent use, however it hasn't survived. The tape often doesn't come out of the exit but goes into the mechanics and has to be pulled out. Sometimes it won't move forward and you hear clicking noises like gears grinding. I've given up on it.

I bought this as something to use around the house for myself and my 8 year old. Now I am throwing it away and looking for something sturdier made",2
you can use A4 paper and draw the edges to DIY similar ones as these.,2
Kinda of a piece of junk.,2
Ink is not permanent and rubbed off everything You need to use on matt finished paper only,2
Doorstop does the job but because of the make up of the material it still slips a bit.,2
These helped my binder paper from breaking. However i bought this item because i wanted the stickers to come off easily and the boxmade it hard to peel them off.,2
The package came opened already and some self adhesives were used. It is very clear. The roll was messed up. But it does it job and I was able to fix my papers :),2
"did not realize these were ""paper"" instead of ""plastic""",2
"Although these are nice looking dividers, they went a little overboard with the wipe-off feature.  Even sharpie wipes off the tabs, so if you are using the dividers in a binder that is often used, the labels will get smudged almost immediately, no matter what writing utensil you're using.  I ended up writing on stickers and sticking them on the tabs which works fine, but doesn't look as clean as I want.  If you're looking to reuse dividers often and need to change the tab names (I'm not sure why you would), then these are for you.",2
"this product.. wow what the ???? do not buy this. I wanted it to work, I have tried adjusting it being gentle resetting the tape going slower going one letter at a time going backward, going forward I have tried it all reloading it, putting it in a different way, you name it I have tried it., and nothing has helped it, I wanted it to work but nothing I do helps the little guy, it is trash. I so wanted it to work, I love the look of the tape and I am sure other scrap booker's and artist and people who want to be organized want it to be fixed but for the lucky few this just isn't that item. they need to go back to the drawing board fix it and resell it and send everyone who bought  one  a new one (free of charge) and package it differently they could really make quite a bit of money if they fixed it and sold it right.",2
erasers are bad,2
"The labels produced look good. That's exactly what I wanted. The cutting position doesn't work at all. Seriously, you're better off advancing the tape until you can cut it with scissors than to fight with god himself to cut the tape. I took the whole thing apart to investigate and sure enough there was a microscopic fragment of label stuck to the blade inside. I removed that, put the whole thing back together, and it still doesn't cut to save its life. If it did cut, that might actually save its life, because I might end up smashing this thing against the wall if I use it too much.",2
"They do the job, but you get what you pay for.  Our company uses Paper Mate mechanical pencils all the time, so I thought this would be a great value, and I was less than pleased with them.
They break way to easily at the top of the pencil (plastic body is just not thick enough).  We've used about a dozen of them and every one of them have done the same thing.",2
They jam up our laser printer when fed through as instructed. Be aware- you may become the pariah of the office.,2
Don't waste your money. Cheaply made and no all letters punch clearly.,2
"Pencil lead breaks very easily.  This product doesn't compare to the Papermate Sharpwriter that has a swivel tip. I purchased this one because I liked the colors instead of the original yellow, but this product is not worthy of the  Papermate name.",2
"Works ok but the trigger is inconsistently hard to engage and the lettering is not very uniform.

Stick backing on tape roll does not bond well with metal or plastic.

It just not a very well built product and they used cheap materials.",2
I don't know what to say about these pencils. I got the 4 pack for $1 which I think is still a waste of money since even for cheap mechanical pencils they suck. The only good thing about them is the eraser which I'm scared to use up since that's the better way of putting lead into them. I can never write nicely with these pencils because one the lead is the worst I've ever seen. Two since there is nada grip it gets more hard to write. The feel of plastic just is not enough for me to hate these though they are still useable when you have nothing else :). Anyone reading do not get these pencils go with the Bic. Much better quality then this.,2
get what you pay for,2
Arrived open and unsealed.,2
"Not fast at giving up its ink, possibly old.",2
The item is exactly as described. I guess I had forgotten how outdated 70's items are. It did what is says but I returned it and the labels for something else.,2
"Large, awkward to use, clunky and I would rather I find my 40 year old little gold colored chunkalong Dymo labelmaker again. It is totally hiding so I bought this. It's just plain yeukky. Cutter-off-er is not good, I can't blankspace on it, and it feels rinkydink, shoddy and just plain trashy to use. I end up having to try to peel the backing by scraping at a corner with my fingernails and it more gums it off than cuts it and the spacing on end of cut and start of next bit is just bad. If I hadn't ordered it online it would have gone back. It is relegated to the greenhouse to make pot labels for my various cuttings. Yes I bought it because I wanted raised/embossed labels not flatprint. Wish I wouldn't have bought it. It got two stars because it does work, just that I wish I wouldn't have bought it had I been able to try one first, and had this been my first Dymo product purchased it would have been my last.",2
"I wish I'd sent them back in the 30day period.  They are thick and sturdy, but almost no elasticity.  I have to spend a moment stretching each one (great arm workout :)) before I can use it and even after that it is hard to use.  I would not repurchase.",2
While much thinner - they are MUCH cheaper also - you get what you pay for.  That being said - I actually received ONE - not the pack of 12 and that ONE had a sticker on it stating it was a pack of 12.  Not only has the quality gone down but the people pulling them need to learn to read.  These are made for storage not handling.  They serve the purpose.  I will look elsewhere next time.,2
Requiring us to use their cards to use their time station is expensive. We have hundreds of leftover cards we would like to use.  Note that we have constant problem with double printing so their card codes do not prevent that.,2
"Okay, so these business cards aren't all that expensive, but if you can afford to spend about $12 knowing that only about 60 of the cards will print well enough to actually be used, well, kudos.

First things first, I have a really nice printer. My ink cartridge is brand-new. Yet any sort of image I tried to print came out fuzzy. One of the designs that I tried never dried properly (even after sitting out in the air for half an hour after being printed). So I tried using just text, but the first two cards on the page would print in the proper font and the rest would revert to the default font!

That brings me to the Avery.com templates - don't bother, they don't work. No matter how many times I realigned, played with my image and text layouts, etc. - the first two cards would print okay, and the rest would be a disaster. I bought these cards despite the bad reviews that stated exactly what I found in regards to the templates and problems with printing them, thinking ""hey, I'm pretty good with computers/printers/technology in general, I'll be able to figure it out"". Nope, nope, nope. Go to VistaPrint or a similar site and print a couple hundred business cards for $20. It's worth it.",2
Bad design. Unless you are using a 2 inch binder you won't end up using all of these in the set. They are way too thick and the tabs are exposed along the sides when the binder is closed. The printable labels are cheap and take extra care to line up and put in without bending and creasing. Not happy with my purchase at all. Likely will return.,2

I used to use these when I was young, summer jobs, etc, and I was figuring they had gotten better by now.  Yes and no:

The edges are now clean, and break off the main paper very nicely.

However, they are still light and flimsy.  They also curl in a little.  Perfect for very cheap business cards, or times when you don't need that many (summer jobs), but I wouldn't be able to hand these out among professionals and not feel a little embarrassed.  I wish they made heavier/firmer paper, but I can't find any for at home printing anywhere.

One other problem specific to this one is that the cards are adjacent (no buffer area), so I don't recommend printing to the edge, or doing anything that needs to be on the border on these cards.  I used their template and either there would be a gap to the bottom graphic or the card below would get a little line on top.  It would take a while to get perfect - but the type of people who wouldn't be surprised at receiving this card are probably the same people who wouldn't notice gaps or stray ink.  Oh well.",2
"I purchased the ASSORTED set.  Unfortunately for me, the box I received only had THREE of the wider bands.  The remaining bands were of varying diameters but all were really narrow making them unsuitable for my needs.  I like the colors, but I will have to find some that are more substantial than what these ended up being.  The bags with all one size look like very nice bands, but they are overkill for how they would be used here.",2
"these boxes are okay, but I would NOT call then heavy duty, good for filing, pictures, papers, dcor.  Nothing over 20 lbs.",2
"Like many reviewers, I too found this product particularly difficult to work with.  The paper continually stuck to the laminate.  I ended up wasting about half the roll (requiring me to purchase a second roll), because I couldn't get the paper off.  I purchased this product, because I needed the larger size.  In hindsight, I will just pay the extra money to have it done professionally.",2
"Great concept but poor execution. Nice, simple idea but they still managed to screw it up.

It's usually pretty easy to just slide coins in until the tube is filled to the side slot and empty any above that if you drop too many in. However, since the tube is opaque you can't visually tell if the coins are all lying flat and it was not uncommon when dumping them into the paper tubes that it was obviously a few coins short of a full load and had to be redone.

The real mystery is why the slot in the penny tube is above the 51 pennies level. Is this more Government bailing out the banks by ripping the customers off by 2%? The quarter tube was correct. Quite frankly I was so sick of counting pennies after a couple hours I started putting 53 in a roll.

Would be a good product if there was a transparent or translucent strip down the side of the tube to see if any coins are cattywampus and the side slot was in the correct place.",2
The backing is very difficult to remove. The quality of the pouch is not really good. I can't even success one good picture laminate (with a lot of spend time). It's very hard to laminate anything large because it always happen to get rip when you separate the backing.,2
"Wrinkly, thin, and they do not grip the pages enough to keep them in.",2
Not what I needed. Was too fat and long. oh well,2
Bad design. Unless you are using a 2 inch binder you won't end up using all of these in the set. They are way too thick and the tabs are exposed along the sides when the binder is closed. The printable labels are cheap and take extra care to line up and put in without bending and creasing. Not happy with my purchase at all. Likely will return.,2
"What else is there to say?  These are not heavyweight by any stretch of the imagination.  Maybe they are trying to redefine what ""heavyweight"" means and hope it catches on.",2
Too thin and flimsy. two thumbs down.,2
Not good. Too much work to sort coins.,2
"very disappointing - we were looking for actual heavyweight sheet protectors, and these were just normal weight - misleading labeling...",2
"Printing on the business cards was not intuitive or easy. The instructions that come with the package aren't very clear. Additionally, they are supposed to be clean edge but when I pulled them out of the sheet they did not have a clean edge. In fact some of them ripped. I think you are better off getting them professionally made.",2
Lock is made of a soft metal. And the box is thin. I'm no body builder and I was able to pry open this box with my bare hands. It's not supposed to be a safe so I'm not going to return it but I would not recommend.,2
"I use a lot of these sheet protectors for filing away magazine articles and design photos, so I chose these because they are acid free and ""archival safe"".  I'm trying several types and brands.  These are not up to par.  They are being sold as heavyweight but they are very light and flimsy, and they are not even the thinnest ones they sell.  The equivalent made and sold by Staples is much better (except that the Staples Clear are really more frosted).  The sheets are clear and there is no fogging or spots, but overall they're just too flimsy.  I know Avery makes an even heavier version, but not sure if I want to buy from them again, after their marketing of these ones.  Why don't you just make one version and make them well.",2
"I like the card stock, but printing them can be tricky. I used Word to set them up, but had a hard time getting a good print. Wasted a lot of ink and several sheet before finally accomplishing my goal. Search how to set these in Word using your printer before hand.",2
I could barely get these through the printer before the perforations had ripped apart. Vanish any ideas of double sided cards....,2
"I researched similar boxes, and this seemed my best bet.  Arrived undamaged and apparently new, but lid has wider gap in some places than others (which seems to me would undermine the fire resistance) and lock is a tad crooked.  It seems they don't make them like they used to.",2
Great for its intended purpose but my package was missing my numbered 18 tab,2
"The box does only what it says it's supposed to do -- keeps file papers under lock and key. The box is a very light gauge metal (lunch box grade), easily bent or dented and has a minimal lock mechanism with just a rudimentary bar of metal as a latch. This is an low security storage box -- seems like anyone with a screwdriver could pry the lid open. Both rails for the file dividers are actually set far from each other and are too low in the box -- file dividers pop right off the rails as the base of the dividers rest right on the box bottom, and the hangar ends of the dividers won't sit securely within the rail tracks. I had to gingerly use pliers to adjust both tracks so the dividers set in place. If potential water damage is a factor, the holes for the handle clasps and the piano hinge at the back of the lid are open to the inside, so if rainstorm damage or office sprinklers could be a problem for valuable papers, this box just won't provide protection. I'm being picky about these details, especially at this low price (and especially utilizing Amazon's free shipping) but all of these items might have been taken care of at the outset, making for a more satisfactory and secure box.",2
"This curls badly in my printer even when fed one at a time through the bypass drawer.  Every other sheet either jammed and got destroyed or printed off center.

The traditional ones worked better for me but left the curly edges.

The bottom line is that if you are going to use these for professional purposes, you owe it to your career to get professionally printed cards.  Oh wellI'd be returning these.",2
"Good idea in theory but my key broke second attempt.  So, down to one key, and hardware store cannot make a copy (too small a cut-out in middle plus key is fairly thin overall anyway).  Cannot find a place to order an extra key either -- which is dumb since the keys ARE numbered.  Sheeesh.
Since the middle notch-out/cut-out on mine is so narrow (2mm) that it was a wonder it lasted more than one use.
Downside: cannot leave unlocked or door top flops open.  I had mostly wanted it in case of fire -- not for security.  Anyone breaking in home and stealing it could get in it in seconds without a key anyway.
I suppose I could leave it unlocked and place a zip tie or rubber band around it.  Meh.",2
Not truly clear and crisp,2
Got these just to see how they look. I was not impressed. I ran a few sheets and all the cards have very visible perforation marks on them and look very bush league and cheap.,2
"Terrible, cheap product. Don't know if it would hold up under fire. My box was dented, had alignment problems and was loose fitting. Look elsewhere.",2
"These are only useful if you need to put no more than about 5 or 6 pages in them, or smaller pieces of paper. When you put more than that in them, they cover the wholes, thus defeating the whole point of having a binder pocket. Pretty crappy...",2
Flimsy,2
"My bad on not reading the colors in the description that do not include the PURPLE pocket seen in the picture (which is why I bought this item)... that being said, I realize there are benefits of using cheap, flimsy pockets such as having less bulk & being lighter to carry around... however, after several brands & varieties of pocket dividers (many of which are Avery) these are near the top of my list of items I won't reorder.  They were SO inexpensive though that I will not take the time & energy to return them... Two of them are very CLOUDY in appearance... they seem extra wide so will use them in the back of binders to hold a handful of forms for easier access for now.  Avery and Others make some wonderful products that I would recommend but I do not recommend these.",2
The lock is flimsy and feels as if it could be broken with little effort which defeats the purpose. I would not recommend utilizing this box for money or other valuable items.,2
"Very thin and flimsy, making it difficult to get pages in and out.  I should have spent the extra money for heavier/thicker one.",2
Alright,2
"I like the clean edge cards.  The only thing I don't like doing, and I've had to do this on other busincess card paper, was to trim the edges with a cutter.  Every time.  The calibration didn't work for me and I followed the instructions as written.

If you don't mind having to trim them further, than what you need, either that, or don't use any color near the edges.  Because you may get a white strip that has to be cut.",2
"I did not like these pages. There is a lot of wasted space and the top loading makes the picture at the top of the page with no margin, while there is a lot of empty space in the middle and sides. I will not be reordering these.",2
I was looking for a personal home budget system. This is more suited fir a company. There are lots of entry spaces that aren't needed for a single person or small family.,2
The idea is great but the tab sticks out from my binder. Not good.,2
"it's overall a good lock box, however mine came with out a handle.. I needed it the day I got it so I just have to use it with out one kinda stinks",2
Works fine enough on one or two pieces of regular paper.  Definitely not for punching a lot of holes.  I wanted to use it on heavier stock paper for my planner and it does not work unless I do one piece of paper at a time and use two hands.  After four months of light use it broke.  Completely fell apart while I was punching a hole.  Not worth it.,2
Does not lock shut tight.  The lid opens almost a half an inch even after it is locked.  Not a good lock box for anything other than keeping semi-valuable or important things from kids.  You can jimmy it open easily.,2
"Broken after 1 week of active using. The tip became flat and now it cannot go through a hole.
Very disappointing.",2
"Very disappointed, especially for $50.  The plastic tray is excellent.  The metal box is flimsy, and it arrived slightly torqued to one side so it doesn't close well.  The metal tabs that go down into the locking mechanism were both misaligned because they were welded in place crooked.  When locked, anyone could grab the corner and bend it open with little effort because it is very light gauge and the lid's overlap is very, very little.  The lid does not stay open (until you force it back a bit beyond vertical at the risk of torquing it even more than when it arrived), and there is no handle anywhere on the box for carrying.  Two rivets hold the locking mechanism in place, and it rocks back and forth easily, making exact alignment of the locking mechanism and the tabs from the top difficult.  I spent half an hour bending things to get them to align and work properly.  If I hadn't desperately needed it the day after it arrived, it would have gone back!",2
"Bought this chest, looking for an additional layer of protection within my larger fireproof safe, and because the dimensions were the best available for my needs. It arrived poorly packaged, with four of eight corners damaged.  Was able to fix the sheetmetal damage - disregard the cosmetic appearance. The lid appears to be too large for the case. There's an extra one-quarter inch clearance between each of the four sides of the lid and the case. I question the fireproof capability with those large gaps in the insulation. It wasn't worth sending back. So, I kept the first one and reordered another - same issues with the second one. I would return both if they were my only fireproof barrier, but since I keep them both in a large, fine quality fire and waterproof safe, they'll do as a simple additional lockbox with some [anticipated] additional fire protection.

Come on, Amazon - how about some effective Quality Control within your Shipping Department. Sometimes Amazon ships with the perfect and most creative packaging. Other times the packaging is almost non-effective. Even though, I'll keep Amazon.com as my primary source for online shopping.",2
"These are so cheap and flimsy, yet they are the same item number as the ones that I was looking to refill which are super heavyduty and have the slanted tab in the top left corner for ""easy page entry""

Also, they have a horrible glare on them that makes it hard to see page contents when in a bright room.",2
"I bought these because it seemed like a good idea; why spend the same amount for only 5 blades from the grocery store? Maybe they're cheaper for a reason? Yeah, they are.
These blades are not the exact #11 size. Essentially, they weren't ground down properly, so the don't fit the correct way in the handle.
I would return them but, Ill admit, Im too lazy to do that. Buyer beware.",2
could not get to lock properly,2
"It fell apart as soon as they tried to remove the punched holes. The cap that holds the punched holes inside came off and is not able to go back on. So it still works, however it now makes a big mess whenever it is used.",2
"First off, the $ PRICE ! The small number of one sided pages per order ! Secondly,
the Tabs come as a bonus unless you realize soon thereafter, that you could have
purchased an adhesive backed tab, sold separately but would meet your need.

This product does have more durable pages, but not worth the $ 9 expense. Each page holds ten
very small business cards. If you own or collect business cards of 2.5 inches width, or debit card
 sized, then forget it, unless you plan to trim every paper card that you receive. Impossible
if you planned to store rarely used plastic cards. More than half of the standard sized business
cards that I planned to store, will have to be trimmed, individually.

Once you've gotten over what you actually spent for just five pages, and commit to using, you
will have to literally Force Each Binder Ring Hole for Each Page ! No your Ring Binder may not
do the job, not without swearing and tearing a few holes. Some were completely sealed. Only a
sharp object ( not a ball point pen, or dull scissor tip ) will permit you. All this work, coupled with
the $ paid for these, will give you some doubts of your own sanity towards this purchase  ) :",2
I am very disappointed with this hole puncher. I have an old one (Gem) that punches cleaner and is easier on the hand. I thought this Swingline would be much better but I was wrong. Back to the old one....,2
I use these to cut paper and the sharp tip breaks every single time after about five cuts. This makes the blade useless. I prefer paying a bit more and getting the titanium X blades. The tip of those rarely breaks and it stays sharp for many projects.,2
Pretty thin even for economy.,2
I didn't really like the feel of it or the way it was laid out . I would not recommend to a friend,2
The quality of these banker boxes keeps getting worse.  The lid doesn't fit very well and the cardboard edges are thin and want to tear.  Just get some free Xerox boxes from your work office.,2
Poorly made. Punched 2 holes and it was in the trash.,2
Difficult to use with printers and they smudge very easily.,2
"These ""economy"" sheet protectors are simply cheap.  They are too flimsy to easily use.  WilsonJones sells a better product - Avery might too, but this is not it.",2
"I am not impressed.  Sure, if you manage to get it just right, your tabs will look gorgeous.  But it is SO difficult to get right!  I wouldn't recommend these tabs...old school dividers with tabs that you can either write on or print out label for are MUCH easier and more practical for most uses.",2
"Sigh, cheap... The punch doesn't exactly line up with the hole in the lower jaw piece. I can press the handle slightly while squeezing it to successfully punch holes. I don't care that much, I don't need to punch very many holes, but it IS an established brand. I mean, it's only a hole punch for criminy sakes.. but, IF one had to punch gazillions of holes, on a daily basis.. my advice would be to source a higher quality tool. There are lots of applications in life where marginally acceptable, kinda shoddy but cheap little tools are perfectly fine.. But, they are still shoddy cheap tools, and if you want a really decent, well made, hole punch, look elsewhere.",2
I love Avery products but these sheet protectors are very thin and flimsy. They aren't easy to open and they are very slick as well so they slide all over the place. Next time I will buy the heavy duty.,2
"Eight-page tabbed dividers can be surprisingly expensive, so this set can be a frugal choice as long as you are aware of its limitations.

The multicolored tabs are of sturdy, semi-transparent plastic. The cardstock inserts are similarly rugged. However, the 8.5x11 dividers themselves are surprisingly flimsy. Although the weight of the stock isn't specified, it is comparable to multipurpose laser-printer paper. Even worse, the reinforcements surrounding the ring punch-outs -- the portions of each page subject to the greatest and most frequent stress -- have very little reinforcement.

The portion of this eight-page set I used daily -- and gently -- lasted less than a week before tearing. The dime-store version I used in the rest of that binder survived much better, although the tab clarity was less satisfactory. The remaining pages of the set have survived about five weeks' delicate and infrequent use, but there's obvious wear at the site of the rings.

Bottom line, if you are considering these for routine school or office use, keep looking. They are acceptable only for one- or maybe two-inch binders that receive just occasional use.",2
"I would say these are great for a reasonably prices product
BUT
They don't fit in my upright magazine boxes! I use those for tons of papers, binders, 2 pocket folders, but these don't fit! Perhaps I should have checked the dimensions, but whoda thunk??",2
"Its ok but when write a receipt its copy on the following receipt , they should have a carton or something to seperate them",2
Poor quality for the price.,2

"The perforations are not very deep, so you have to fold back-and-forth along the crease twice to get a clean break from the pages.  Even then, they just don't tear very easily, so you often get rips on the pages.  This was very frustrating when I was trying to write a bunch of these to people all at once and trying to process them quickly.

The copy goes through very easily, so it looks very clear on the second page. . . the problem is that it goes through several pages at a time.  With nothing to block it, it will show up clearly on two carbon copies.  It will show up bad enough on a third and forth carbon copy that you won't be able to use those pages, and it shows up slightly on the carbon copy which is five below the one you tried to write on.  I caught the mistake early, and tried to place a small stack of about three papers behind the original to block it from going through that far, and it still went through.  You will definitely need to lie it flat on the table with no other copies underneath it or find something like a piece of plastic to block it better than I was able to.  There is nothing included with the receipt pad that you can use to block it (some pads have a little piece of cardboard you can flap over, but this one doesn't.)

I was trying to process a bunch of receipts quickly, and I was very frustrated with the way the pages tore and how easily the copies went through.  If I were writing one or two of these at a time and not in a rush, this would have probably been an acceptable notepad with a much more favorable review.  They were reasonably priced and definitely provided a clear copy for the customer.",2
Poor quality for the price.,2
"Was disappointed,  didn't realize the sides are open, it is not a closed folder like a packet,  it is a folder like a manila folder,  I taped the sides to keep employee info from falling out.  Should have gotten the ones at office depot.",2
"I bought it, but never used it for it was too bulky",2
It's too small to fit your credit cards.,2
Was what might happen if I turned the cash box over when I carried it around in a backpack.  It turns out that this box spills all the bills and all the change into all the other compartments if it's not held completely flat.  It might as well have had only 1 compartment.,2

"Posted a few reviews for this but each time had it removed.

- basically the p@ckaging was d@maged..  the ream of paper was split 0pened.
- very dis@ppointed in the handling of the product.",2
"I'm really sorry I purchased 12 of these. Mead was a name I trusted for office products, but that is not the case with these composition notebooks. The covers are much thinner and less durable than they used to be and bend easily. The inside paper is thin and tears, plus I've had issues with bleed-through when using certain kinds of pens. I'm going to donate them and look for something of better quality. These just don't work.",2
"The covers are flimsy, and while I`d persistently worked with Amazon for over 3 weeks to get the company, Connect Buy, to honor their add on line of  red and blue notebooks and send me one of each, they refused to do so. Their add is misleading and false advertising(""one of colors shown"": BLUE and RED), and either needs to be changed IMMEDIATELY, or the company should immediately honor their customers righteous requests. If a customer really doesn`t care what they get, if anything, they should buy one of these. Otherwise, I warn them not to. Their attitude even today after I received a green and red one is insensitive and practically non-responsive...not even an apology was offered!!! Shame!!!",2
Could not get use to the extra firmness of the memory foam seat rest - made me very uncomfortable.,2
"I have to now agree with other reviewers, it is not soft enough. AND, as reported, it doesn't fit what is an average sized office chair, too small. I had to return it.",2
I didn't realize it would have little colored specks on both sides of each sheet.,2
"This paper on it's own is great.  It has a nice weight and is the right size. It has a nice smooth finish.  However, the package arrived open.  as in totally, falling apart, open in the box.  And since the cat treats also fell out of their packaging, it had some spots on it from the cat treats.  I find with Amazon, half of the paper I order comes in damaged. Since I am using it for crafting purposes and not for business where every sheet needs to be perfect, it is not worth sending it back.  But I might go elsewhere for paper if you need the whole ream, because this is not acceptable.",2
"I wanted white card stock. I bought ""stardust"" white not realizing it has tiny dots of random color through it.  Anything I print on it looks like it has mistakes in it.  It just looks like random tiny ink spots.  I do not know who would find this useful, it's not like a textured color, or a graphic design. I would have liked the paper if it had been plain white.",2
Really had to do lots of adjusting to fit my desk chair that is not padded.  Ended up putting it on sideways and doing various tricks at the back so that it would stay in play.  I would guess it would work much better for padded chairbacks.,2
"I like the thickness of the pages, BUT it is not completely plain white...it has speckles on both sides of the pages!  Not very happy.",2
"I usually order from Amazon this particular product because it comes in the same packaging and is well kept for the considerate long journey it comes from. However this time, only half of the box came in its original packaging. The other half was under the packaged paper, it was loose, and half of it was dirty and crinkled.
I had to throw it away, because it would have jammed the printer if I had used it.
So ultimately it was a waste of money.",2
"Warning, this paper is not white. The color is Stardust White. It is actually a cream color with other colored flecks in it.",2
"These dividers are not thick enough to do much good.  It is almost impossible to get the labels into the slots (one label got mangled on the end, and several dividers got bent while I was trying to insert the label).  Not happy with this purchase.",2
"The entire package of paper was ripped open from seam to seam.  It had obviously been sent to another person, opened, returned, and sent out again without any quality control.  I'm not even sure I got a full package of paper.  I have no issues with the quality of the actual paper.  It is what you'd expect from a thick weight paper and is a true, bright yellow like a lemon.  However, the way it was presented was horrible.",2
"First off,THESE ARE EXCELLENT NOTEBOOKS! I use them specifically for research and taking notes for my writing projects;I like the way they are structured. The problem is this:the price! They are way too expensive on Amazon! You can go to your local Walmart or pharmacy and purchase them a few dollars cheaper...the choice is yours.",2
"I bought a new home office chair that turned out to have an uncomfortable seat. I bought this cushion, thinking it would be as comfortable as my memory foam mattress. Not close. Not only was there no noticeable change in comfort, this pad is unusually small--not really standardized for the average work or dining chair. I suppose they have to size it to fit the smallest seat, but it really missed the mark.",2
"These tabs are irregular sized. I regularly need to make professional presentations and go through numerous tabs, so I bought a lot of these and found that I have to cut the tabs down to make them fit properly in my folders and binders. The tabs preform at or near expectations, other than the size issue.",2
"5 starts for the quality, 1 for the colour description. Stiff, nice quality, shipped safely so there are not banged up edges. HOWEVER, be careful. The""stardust white"" is not white. I expected the flecks of colour as shown in the product preview. What it doesn't show is that the base colour is not white, it is more of a light light tan heading towards camel/gray. If you are wanting a base of actual white, go to a different brand. Otherwise you'll end up paying $13 for 250 sheets of the wrong colour.",2
All reams in the carton . . . the wrappers broken and ripped. Carton smashed.,2
"Blades don't have the razor sharp edge I've come to expect from this type of blade. I'll still be able to use them, just not for the projects I bought them for.",2
Paper is good quality. However the white is grayish in tone... I couldn't figure out why my colored copies were off. That was when I took notice the paper was not a pure white next to my previous paper order.,2
A gift for my daughter for Christmas but she wanted another Avery Sheet Protectors.,2
"I thought the price was too good to be true...and it was.  These sheet protectors are very, very flimsy and tore immediately.  I would prefer to pay a little more and get a more sturdy and substantial product.  They might meet your needs, but they did not meet mine.  If you want a quality product, I would not buy these sheet protectors.",2
This is just a folder with dividers - not at ALL a sorter of any kind! Don't waste your money on this.,2
"if you are even moderately ""plus size"" this will be too narrow for you. frankly, i think it's too narrow for most americans, and it's certainly much more narrow than any of the office chairs i have ever sat in.",2
The package came open,2
"my bad...missed on the description that it was legal size...won't likely use this up before I die in 30 yrs, just not much use for legal size paper anymore unless you are a lawyer which we are not.",2
Package was torn/ripped. Paper was exposed.,2
"Excellent quality paper product, however ream's outside packaging was torn open with some edge damage to sheets.",2
"This paper is a very bright white, but is not suitable for printing color images with an inkjet printer. This paper might work well for laser printers, but I do not recommend it for inkjet printing. Images printed on this paper with an inkjet printer are faded and grainy. If you want good color prints with an inkjet printer you really need a coated paper.",2
my pkg arrived with half the pkg paper bent could not use it in the printer,2
Feels like cheap paper. I hate it. Husband bought it because it WAS cheap. i like the HP in the purple wrapper much better... john's wife.,2
poor contrast with pencil or pen,2
"Not vellum, color is too pale/dull.",2
"I realize there are people who think only the paper should be reviewed, but a) there isn't that much to be said about name-brand copy paper, b) the poor shipping is just plain ridiculous and c) the review is about the value of the product, which is greatly diminished when it arrives damaged.

I will not be ordering from shoplet again. They stuffed the paper into a cardboard box with one row of packing pillows on one side so that it was *guaranteed* to be damaged during shipping. The Hammermill package was torn open on both ends by the force of the s-bend that the row of packing pillows forced the paper into. There was no possible way it was going to arrive in one piece.

Almost 10% of the paper is damaged beyond use in a copier or printer. Fortunately I take a lot of notes and sketch a lot of design diagrams by hand so I can use the damaged pages for other purposes.

The paper has a very nice satin finish too it, it feels slippery to the touch. Fortunately that finish makes it very nice to draw on using fine-point sharpies as that's what a bunch of it will have to be used for.",2
Im less than pleased with the quality of this paper. I specifically bought it because I needed 110lb stock to complete some printing for a bridal shower.  You can see from the 2 pictures I attached the thickness is way off.  Both stacks contain 25 printed items. The stack on top/left was printed with 110lb stock purchased at JoAnn Fabric. The bottom/right was printed with this paper.  It goes without saying which stack is obviously thicker.  I think this brand is significantly thinner but because Im in a pinch and need these printed I had to go with it. I will not purchase this again.,2
The cardboard backing is way too floppy.  I'll order something else in the future.,2
"I do NOT think this is 110lb. I agree with the other reviews, I would say it is maybe 80 or 90 lb. It is a nice bright white but I will not buy again!",2
"I have a very large , large -print bible which won't fit in anything so tried this one but it is way way way too big",3

"Okay case for the Adventure Bible. Won't last long because of cheapness.

I bought this for my 7yo's adventure Bible to help keep it clean and protected. The material does seem a bit cheap, but it looks nice enough and he likes it. It's a very thin, weak feeling nylon. She LOVES all of the many pockets. There's always a place to keep whatever she gets at church that day.

The handle seems pretty secure, but I guess I could see that the material it's attached to could rip if it were treated casually. other reviewers have said it can fall off easily.

So far, so good. All in all, nice case to fit the Adventure Bible",3

Okay,3
"I am homeschooling my son for Kindergarten this year and I wanted this chart to help him see how to count by 5's and 10's. The description says it's layered with plastic so that you can write and wipe-away.

In reality, this product comes wrinkled, ripped, and in my particular case, some of the ink rubbed off of the word ""Counting"". While the chart does as it says in regards to the numbers, it is very poorly made.

I could have probably had a similar chart printed up at a professional printers for cheaper and with better material if I wasn't so busy. This item should be priced at half of what they are charging (it is currently $9 and some odd cents).

The back of this thin chart says ""Printed in China"" so I guess that explains the poor quality. I'm not usually one to spout off about ""Made in America"" but this is one product that has no reason to be made in China. I'm pretty sure we have the capabilities to produce this right here in our own country...

If you plan to purchase this, I recommend you prepare yourself for the sorry state it will arrive in. Maybe taking it to a place that can laminate it with the proper plastic would be best if you care to spend more money.",3
"My seven year old and I read it once...  He lost interest, and I think the story is ""choppy""  to big of a story for such a short book.  Should have just checked it out at the library, or borrowed it, if that were an option.",3
did not realize just how large this was i'll figure another way to use it,3
"This calendar is pretty, but not very practical. It would have been nice if the pieces were separated. It took a very long time to separate the pieces. I also wish that the days of the week were bigger.",3
"Cheap, no laminated..careful if small student have to use it",3
"Item is ok.  It really isn't what I was expecting, but it is decent for the price especially since it was quite a bit cheaper than what Scholastic offered it for.  It says it builds phonemic awareness, but I think that might be stretching it.  I guess I was expecting songs that reinforced the letter sounds.  They don't do that. Helps with letter awareness, but not sure it does much beyond that.  Each song is on a different track.  Some are rather short and then you need to start them over to play it several times for your child to get the hang of it.",3
"It works great as a magnetic board for working with magnetic letters. However, it is VERY hard to erase dry erase marker off of it. As a teacher, I am disappointed in Scholastic about this issue. I bought 2. One for my guided groups table and one for the kids to use in a center. I do like that they fold flat when not in use and they are pretty sturdy. I just wish we could ERASE the dry erase marker off of them without resorting to scrubbing.",3
Not as good as expected,3
A lot smaller than expected.,3
"I didn't realize how small it was.  I really like William Morris, but not sure I would purchase this again as I was hoping for a larger notebook.",3
"I bought this to get the super saver shipping. Not much to say other than it's pretty good looking. It is not easy to rip out pages, and I missed the fact that is wasn't lined, but it does the job for the most part. It's alright, but I doubt I'll be buying it again.",3
Very small not worth the money,3
"There's nothing much to say. It's a basic journal. Not the best thing out there, but good for a young girl who wants to draw pictures or practice writing in cursive. I won't be buying any more of these.",3
Smaller than I thought it would be.,3
Like the cover art but only about 4x5 inch blank paperback bound low number of pager and paper cover. Good for a quick write but don't expect to last long.,3
Bought to make a 99 cent more for free shipping. Fits well in my purse.,3
Tiny but pretty.,3
"I was a little disappointed at the small number of pages in this notebook for the price, and the way it was put together at the binding seemed low quality to me (i.e., the pages won't lay flat when it's opened).",3
"Pretty cover, much smaller than I expected it to be, but maybe I didn't read the description closely. Good notebook for your purse to jot reminders on. Good item to add to amazon when you need just a little more to get free shipping.",3
"I wasn't expecting it to be quite so small/flimsy.  It doesn't have a whole lot of pages, but the butterfly design is lovely.  What little paper it contains is of a decent quality for taking notes or jotting down ideas. It fits conveniently in a purse or pocket. I feel that this butterfly notebook was worth the price, although I probably wouldn't be willing to pay any more for it.  I don't regret buying it, but I wonder if maybe a large, hard-cover journal might have been more useful, since I had originally considered using it for keeping track of my poetry ideas.",3
Nice detail but poor quality paper,3
"The Maps are on very thin paper and it becomes difficult to get it on the wall for this reason.
The Map it self is clear and colorful.",3
"The map was creased when it arrived.  I thought that ordering it rolled up meant it would be shipped in a rolled container, but it was just in a long box.  A bit disappointed.",3
"I bought this and the mcnally USA wall map at the same time. I didn't really pay attention to the fact that one was coming folded and the other rolled. So I'm not counting stars off for my folly. However I did want to mention that if you are looking for a wall map get the rolled version. The folded version is a wonderful idea for a large map that could be gotten out to look at on the floor, then stored easily in a drawer or folder the rest of the time.

The stars off are for the quality. If you buy this do not spend over $5 on it (unfortunately I did). That is the top cost I feel is warrented for the quality of this. It is a good size. However it is basically printed on a large peice of cheap copy paper That's the thickness/durability and feel of the paper. There is absolutely no pretense at lamanation on this. I bought clear contact paper to put over it, which is a workable solution.

I bought this for our homeschool classroom, and while I appreciate having cost effective options, in hindsight I would have spent a bit more on a lamanated option that was rolled for our wall map choice.

This is still a nice choice for an easily stored, large world map- as long as the price point is met. I would not suggest the folded version for framing or otherwise displaying on the wall.",3
With a thicker paper will be better,3
I would have liked it better if the roads were in solid black.  This isn't a good map to decide cross country routes with.  Too hard to pick out the roads.,3
"Cool map, but  cuts off both poles. Also ""laminated""  is hardly what I would call the mild gloss on this map, so description at fault there.",3
This chart is the perfect size for limited classroom wall space. Only regret is that there is a seam down the center of the chart which makes it unsuitable for long sentence stips if you want it for multiple usage.,3
This organizer serves its purpose but compared to similar organizers it feels very flimsy.  The material is most definitely not any variety of canvas.  I ended up having to add extra attachments to the wall to keep the papers in it from folding in on itself when I put papers in the pockets.,3
"For the $, I think the inserts should be been precut. I had to use my large paper cutter to cut them all out. There weren't even perforated lines. The chart is as described and I liked the dowel at the bottom to give it weight. Used dry erase and it wipes off every time you move them. Would suggest for a more permanent schedule using sharpie.",3
Mine came with cards too.  I had to cut the cards out by hand though and then laminate them for longevity.  Should have been done for me.,3
it looks a little cheap,3
"This is a TINY pocket chart.  I did read the dimensions, but I guess it just didn't register just how little this thing is.  I opened it up and wondered why I paid more than four dollars for this. It seems kind of cheap to me.  But, it is a sturdy little pocket chart, so I know it won't get torn up easy.  The straws are just small thin plastic straws (think-  coffee stirring straws).  The pocket on the front to store the straws inside of is nice.  The numbers and words come on two small squares of poster board.  The squares are not separated, but it's not a big deal to cut them. The numbers are also small. I I used clear matte con-tact paper to ""laminate"" the numbers so that they won't get torn (worked great).  I would say this is an okay item to purchase if you want it to teach place value, or if you want to use the pocket chart for something else altogether.  Just keep in mind, that it is a rather small pocket chart.  Putting it on a classroom wall would make it look even smaller.  I cannot imagine that this would work in a large classroom if you want to make sure everyone can see it.  A smaller, closer setting would be better.",3
Not as well made as Lakeshore's pocket charts.,3
I like the colors and can use these to teach patterns to my second graders while teaching them essential calendar skills.,3
I like these and they fit perfectly with this specific calendar pocket chart but I don't like how I had to cut them all out by myself.  Very annoying.,3
a bit smaller than what i expected but if you are gonna place them in the pockets i guess it would fit perfect. I personally use it as a poster. you may also need to laminate it if you want it to last.,3
"This is a nice product except for the quality of the sight words. First, cutting them out is risky. Kids do not need practice cutting out such a product. They have other, less costly, things to cut. Secondly, I don't intend to laminate them, and I doubt they will last very long. It looks pretty for now. My question is -- how long will it hold up? For that reason, I gave it 3 stars.",3
You get what you pay for.,3
"The clip is very hard to move and its smaller than it looks.  Wouldn't buy another one, but it works ok.",3
"Too small
Needs to be bigger and longer
Keychain for kids",3
It's hard to tell just how tiny these cards are. The picture makes them look much bigger. They are fun and cute anyhow.,3
need it for school so yea it works,3
"It works as it should, but I will never absolutely love an educational remote. I saw the new versions that kind of remind me of wii controllers, and although they're fancier and even have silicone cases available, if they're not required, then just settle for this ugly, old school clicker.",3
"Second edition is out, and it is what I would recommend getting, but if it is okay to use a first edition it is a great product.",3
Well when it comes down to it this item worked. I just don't understand why classes use them they just waste time.,3
"These are very cute but they do not stick well, as other reviewers have noted. If you need ones that will stick to something and stay there, I would not purchase these. If you like the design and don't really care about sticky, they're great! Good price if you are not expecting them to stick.",3
"This is a beautiful binder that comes with lined recipe pages and categorized divider pages as well as some very useful conversion charts. The divider pages have pockets that allow one to tuck in clipped or loose recipes. If you run out of the recipe pages, you can download a pdf file to print your own, so you never have to worry about running out of matching pages!

Although this is a gorgeous looking set, I find it more useful for a new cook or a new bride that doesn't have a huge collection of recipes yet. For the seasoned cook, I'm not sure it would be as useful with the limited space for pockets. However, if one added page protectors or other types of pockets to the system, it could be more useful, but not nearly as attractive.

This would be a great item to give to a daughter or other girl who is collecting family favorites for when she leaves home. Give it to the new bride as a welcome to the family gift with family recipes to start her on her way or give it blank to let her decide what favorites to add.

All-in-all, I see this mostly as a gift for a younger person starting out and more of a ""meh"" item for the more seasoned cook.",3
"I use this binder to keep track of all the recipes I print online and it's a much more attractive option than my prevoius but functional black standard binder. I like the category dividers, they really helped me be better organized, and the label on the spine (Recipe Organizer) makes it easy to tell what's in it if you have a lot of binders, which I tend to do. I give it 3 stars because mine arrived damaged, though perhaps some would consider that to be more the fault of the way it was shipped than the product itself, but I thought it was worth noting. I like it, but if it was made from plastic instead of cardboard I think it would hold up a lot better and for me something that I use so often needs to be more durable.",3
"This is a very attractive binder for organizing recipes. The binder is sturdy and thick with a good, strong, set of rings that would hold up well under moderate use. The colors are bold and attractive, and the prints vibrant and exciting. The binder itself is organized into eight colorful sections separated by pocket dividers (Fruits & Vegetables, Breads & Pasta, Meats & Poultry, etc.) Each section has a different colored William Morris print, so you can visually tell the sections apart at a glance. Recipes can be three hole punched, tucked into the binder pockets, or copied onto recipe sheets that match the colors of the binder pockets (5 sheets per category, 3 recipes per sheet). Sheet protectors would be a useful addition to this binder to keep printed pages clean and accessible. The front and back covers have helpful information like metric equivalents, a roasting chart, and oven temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius.

This is a nice binder, and probably would be useful for someone far neater and more organized than I am. I am no Martha Stewart, and my kitchen is a busy, messy place where my children are as likely to be cooking as I am. To me, this binder is attractive, but basically useless. Firstly, as most of my recipes are printed off the internet, I would get little use out of the printed sheets. Even my old family recipes have been typed, and other recipes remain in the annotated cook books I got them from. I don't have the patience to hand copy recipes, and I prefer to type because my handwriting is messy. The binder has a fairly durable cover, and is treated so as to be water resistant, but I suspect that in MY kitchen, at least, this binder would quickly get dirty from spills. In addition, I question the utility of a three-ring-binder for long term use. Although I have not tested this one extensively, I generally can count on a year of use from a high quality school binder in daily use. Since this won't get nearly the same level of wear and tear, then perhaps I could get a few years before the binder stops smoothly opening and closing, gets caught, or the cover becomes overly damaged. I doubt this would survive long enough to be passed on down to my children. The binder is also stiff, and inflexible, and doesn't fully close so all my recipes are constantly slipping sideways or to the bottom. I can't easily put the binder on its side either because it is so bulky it takes up a lot of space on my counter, and does not fit easily into my cabinets. In addition to the pointless recipie cards, the pre-printed recipie sections are more or less useless to me. They would have been better off allowing us to customize the dividers ourselves. An entire section dedicated to beverages? Really? And breads combined with pasta when most of my recipies involve either breads or pastas? Clearly this binder is way too fancy for my kind of cooking.

I am not sure this binder, as attractive as it is, warrants a cost of $22. The recipe cards are useless to me, and although the charts in the cover are useful, I could print my own. Also, the recipie subdivisions don't match the way I actually cook. So really what we are looking at is a very expensive, albeit beautiful, binder. I suspect I could find a pretty binder, with a plastic cover, far cheaper than this one. Then I could purchase my own dividers and make the system more appropriate to my cooking style. All in all, I'd pass on this one.",3
"I found this recipe binder to be okay. It has various tabbed sections where you could organize your recipes into different categories and is very pleasing to the eye. The only problem is that you have to use the blank inserts provided (or go online and print out additional copies) to manually write your recipes. This isn't necessarily a huge problem because I can just three-hole punch my printed recipes and organize them in the folder. However, it would have been nice if you could alter the document available online if you wished.",3
"I received the V&A William Morris Recipe Binder for an honest review. Heres my take on it.

The binder is attractively designed in a William Morris floral print, lime green and two shades of teal on a white background.. Similar matching floral prints adorn the eight pocket dividers categorized as Fruits and Vegetables, Breads and Pasta, Eggs and dairy, Soups and Salads, Meats and Poultry, Fish and Seafood, Desserts, and Beverages. In addition to each section, there are four additional double-sided pages in a heavy weight paper for handwritten recipes (two on the front, one on the back). The binder and prints are lovely and would make a delightful gift for family members with favorite recipes included. However, the binder has limitations for my recipe collection, namely, I do not file my recipes under these headings and theres no section for sauces and marinades or pickles and preserves. I have added additional tabbed sheets for these. Also, the binder is constructed of heavy cardboard that is not impervious to spatters that stain so will need to be stored and used away from the cooking area.

These shortcomings are overcome-able, but the three ring section that holds the recipe pages is flawed in that theres no tab at the top or bottom to assist in opening the rings to insert more paper. It can only be done with brute force, something difficult for someone with arthritic fingers.

I like the binder idea and wanted to like it more, but these items make it hard to use and not very practical. What I like are the four conversion charts in the inside cover and the oven roasting and temperature charts on the inside back. So, while not as useful for my purposes as Id like, it still would make a cherished and thoughtful gift.",3
"I keep decades of recipes in an old manila folder, or tucked into the pages of cookbooks, or stuffed into a drawer in my kitchen.  It's always a challenge to find the ones I need.  So I figured the V&A William Morris Recipe Binder would be a wonderful way to organize my recipes and store them together in one convenient place.

The binder itself is very attractive, larger than I expected, and very sturdy.  It's basically a three-ring binder with a heavy cardboard cover and eight pocketed dividers organized by type of recipe (i.e. ""Fruits & Vegetables,"" ""Breads & Pasta,"" ""Meats & Poultry,"" etc.).  Recipes can be tucked into the binder pockets or copied onto pre-printed recipe sheets (each of the eight categories includes five of these sheets, printed front and back - each sheet actually provides space for three recipes, one on the front and two on the back).  Inside the front cover of the binder are charts showing ""Food Equivalents,"" ""Liquid Measures,"" and ""Dry Measures"" (showing metric conversions).  Inside the back cover is a ""Roasting Chart,"" and another showing oven temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius.  The William Morris floral patterns used for the cover and the dividers are lovely.

But is this a convenient way to organize recipes?  Maybe.  The majority of my recipes have been scribbled on pieces of notebook paper, printed from the Internet, or clipped from magazines (some as long ago as forty years!).  I could certainly copy these disintegrating recipes onto the pre-printed recipe sheets in the binder, but I'd like it better if I could type them out, save them, and then print them (the sheets are not formatted in a way that would make this work).  What I plan to do is ignore the pre-printed sheets and just print my recipes out on standard paper, which I can then hole-punch and place into the binder.  But that means a big part of this binder system isn't being used as it was intended.  Please note:  a PDF version of the insert pages is available free of charge from Galison.com, so you can print out unlimited pages; had this not been a PDF file, it would have been possible to type recipes directly into the template, and then print them.  Since it's a PDF file, however, that's not possible.

Basically, this is a fancy-looking three-ring binder with pretty dividers and pre-printed recipe sheets that aren't really necessary.  For less than half the price you could buy a binder and some pocketed dividers, and then set up your own system.  Now that I have this, I will use it.  But I probably wouldn't have purchased it on my own.  It's definitely pretty.  It's just not as practical as it could have been.

UPDATE 1/20/2014:  After working with this a bit, I've found that the categories listed on the dividers don't work all that well for the recipes I collect.  I have a lot of recipes for sauces and marinades, for example, and there is no divider for that.  Additionally, there's no place to put rice dishes or snacks/appetizers.  There's a divider labeled ""Beverages"" which I will not use, so I can re-name it ""Sauces"" -- but that still leaves me with a bunch of recipes with no place to put them.  This would have been a better product had the dividers not been pre-labeled (yet another reason that buying a generic binder and dividers would be better).",3
Disappointing book plates - they are not very big but for the price I guess it's okay.,3
"This book does not really help in many cases. I was wanting a more direct interpretation of my dreams. This book Is more of a guide  to help me interperet my own dreams. I don't want to interperet my own dreams.
In many cases I thought it ran me around in circles.
Not very helpful book for me.",3
"Note: This review is for the *Kindle* version of the 2012 Peanuts daily calendar.

The 2012 Peanuts daily calendar features a cartoon strip for each day of the working week and then combines Saturday and Sunday on one page with one cartoon.  So you end up with six strips per week.  I'm not sure how they picked the strips, although it does seem as though they were from the same time period as several ""plots"" are followed over the course of January.  The featured strips are amusing and often quite thoughtful.

The only problem is the formatting for the Kindle.  I own a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire, and the calendar is a vastly different experience on the two instruments.  The strips do not work well for the Kindle Keyboard's black and white format.  The result is rather drab, depressing, and difficult to read even when one uses the zoom function.  The calendar works much better on the Kindle Fire.  Using the zoom function, the strip ends up at least 1/3 larger than before, which in the color format is quite nice.  The font ends up a tiny bit fuzzy but basically readable.  In both formats, you can take notes on the calendar pages, so one could record meetings, holidays, or important tasks to be completed.

For the Kindle Keyboard, I give it 2 stars and suggest skipping this calendar; hard core Peanuts fans should consider the calendar in another format.  For the Kindle Fire, I give it 4 stars with the caveat that the strips are still imperfectly formatted.",3
"I have always loved Dilbert, and have bought the Day-to-Day Calendars for myself and as gifts for my colleagues for many years now. I must say I am a bit disapointed with the 2011 Day-To-Day Desk Calendar - The 2010 Calendar had one page for each day of the Weekend, and Sunday's page had a joke that was longer, with more panels. The 2011 calendar, on the other hand, has combined pages for Saturday and Sunday into one page, and it is one of the shorter jokes. You are basically getting 52 pages less (one page less for each week) for your money.",3
"It is a bit bulky to carry around and I see that I do not use all of the allotted spots, so although I do like it, mostly, I probably will not buy again.",3
"The cards seem cheaply made. I am using this for homeschooling and think they will hold up fine for my two children, but they would never last long enough to work long-term in a classroom setting.",3
good,3
This was a good summer reading comprehension practice book for my middle schooler to have short sessions of refreshers.,3
"While charming and cute, these notecards are a bit flimsy and the envelopes are VERY thin.  I would save my money and buy something with more substantial weight.",3
Acceptable paper quality.  Very thin envelopes.,3

"The calendar is durable, and the slots large enough to write appointments in easily. However, for all that I love Downton, I didn't especially like the selection of photos. There are others that I could enjoy seeing daily for a month - but a single profile of Carson isn't in that category, as one example.",3
"Cool glow in the dark writing.  The only problem is the writing is to small to read at normal wall calendar viewing distance which I consider to be about 4 to 6 feet, and in the dark it is even harder to read.",3
"This map is beautiful and I would give 5 stars except that it arrived with a crease in it as if someone stepped on the shipping tube. The top edge is a bit jagged as if someone crammed the cap on too quickly and with force. Other than these flaws, the map itself is a beauty.",3
"The map itself was as expected, a big laminated poster...but amazon just tossed it in a box and it was crushed when it arrived.  The whole map was covered in creases.  But I purchased this your my young child so they didn't care about the creases as much as I did.",3
"Thin and not easy to read if you are more than 6 inches away -- but as a decoration, it's decent",3
It is definitely very big; came well packaged and undamaged; not as thick/substantial a material as I'd expected (it's really closer to a poster than anything more substantial).,3
"The ""Traditional"" that is sold by Amazon *IS* laminated, but it is $48 which makes it steep for a map without a frame.

The ""basic size"" and ""enlarged tubed"" that are sold by PosterRevolution are NOT laminated (I contacted them on 12/29/13 and they confirmed this).  Their large size is $28 which is very steep for a non-laminated piece of paper.

Maps, Globes, and More advertised the ""enlarged tubed"" as having ""laminated paper,"" but they shipped me a non-laminated map.  Had I not taken a screen shot of their description at the time I ordered it, I would have had to pay for return shipping out of my own pocket.  Be aware that no one is selling a laminated version of the ""enlarged tubed"" map anymore.

The laminated 48x73 map is AWESOME -- I've received tons of compliments on it and refer to it often.  I had some leftover baseboard from my house renovation that I spray painted Dark Walnut and used to frame this map.....great way to dress a huge blank wall.",3
"I love this map. It is beautiful, the colors are subdued and gives you a warm effect looking at it. It would be suitable for hanging in an executive office. The downside is the very thing laminate that is on the map. I used a thumb tack to hang it on my office wall and when I pulled it tight the paper and laminate ripped right through. So its really not very durable. But it is very pretty and a good price.",3

Conceptually this book is OK.  I got it for a 10-year-old and he is probably likely to get past any useful information very quickly.  The equipment shown and explained is primitive and more on a toy level.  I am sending him a high school student-grade scope that has many features not covered.  I also purchased another book for him which is a bit more detailed and has Internet information available.  Hopefully that will prove to be a more challenging guide.,3
definitely need an adult to help with this book.  Of course... I am an adult and couldn't do it so there you are.  If you are good at science... there won't be problem.,3
A little smaller then I expected to see.  I use it for my 1st grade CCD class.,3
so so,3
It's OK.,3
"I bought these for my daughters! one daughter loved it (8 yrs old), one not so much (10 yrs old). It happened to fall on he ground and now it does not work. Don't get me wrong it should not be hitting the ground at all, but with children that just tends to happen. Also if you don't hit the two buttons at the exact same time it does not ""reset"" too easily. The plastic part is just that, PLASTIC and hard. It is not flexible at all.",3
Died super fast but was okay while it lasted.,3
"Great idea, but it has some quality control issues.  I purchased two of these (one in red and one in blue) and the red one has been just fine.  However, the blue one has been finicky since day one...although I am sure the color has nothing to do with it ;-)  We have had to re-seat the battery a few times (per the manufacturer's instructions on their website) when the screen has gone blank.  I agree with another reviewer who said that the start/stop button needs to be pressed ""just so"" or else it may or may not start/stop.  I wonder if the repeated pressing of the start/stop button in order to make it work properly somehow affects the working mechanism...especially with kids thinking they have to press the button harder to make it work.  The next time we see a blank screen, I intend to request a replacement from the manufacturer.  If that happens, I will update this review to reflect how the company handles this concern.",3
"I bought these for an RCIA class using the catechism prepared following the second Vatican ecmenical council. These tabs apparently match back to an older edition, with page numbers to match. I was still able to use most of them, by finding the page references myself but they are not a perfect match. The tabs themselves are good quality and application was fairly easy, but I might recommend finding an updated set if you plan to use the current catechism, unless you want to spend a lot of time searching and guessing which goes where.",3
This book was a LOT smaller than I had anticipated it being.  Especially for the price.  The outer cover is nice and the pages are ok.,3
"The art is really nice, and the pictures are all nature themes, which I like.  The paper is a nice thick stock, and there are a lot of pictures to choose from.

On the downside, the pages aren't perforated, which makes it hard to hang anything you like... and frankly it's a bit hard to get to the pages while they're in the binding.  The pictures are also on both sides of the page, which means you have to choose which side to hang.  Also, the picture from the other side can bleed through, especially if you use markers instead of colored pencils.  Also, if you're above the age of 35, reading glasses might be required...

"First you get the following Coloursoft pencils:

Derwent Inktense are my fave pencils.  But they're a bit spendy and best for use with water.  I only had a couple of their Coloursoft line so thought this was a good chance to try some more and oh, yes color too!  The pencils are a great quality that I would expect from Derwent.

The book?  Gotta admit it's a bit of a disappointment.  The paper is okay but you're really going to be limited to the pencils, especially given the fact their are prints on both sides of the page (so if you like to use coloring pages in craft projects, this one is probably not ideal).  The pages are also not perforated so again, best for use in the book.  While there are some winning designs that take up the page there are also some that leave a lot of white space or feel like they threw random elements together just to fill space.  Several pages fill like both filler and an attempt to turn it into more of an ""Activity book"" (see.  The Rabbit page  that is repeated with some elements removed and instructions for you to dress the rabbit who is not missing his tie and hat).  One of the things I like about adult coloring books is that they're just coloring books.  So find the insects pages aren't really what I was hoping for.

That said there are some perfectly lovely pages.  I'd put it as average overall.  Some winning pages, some not so much.  Okay paper but nothing exceptional.",3
Very good. Wish mine came with the derwent pencils i must of ordered it wrong.  Shame.,3
"I don't like this as well as I thought I would.  The illustrations have a lot of bolder black lines that, to me, take away from the intricate detail of coloring.  It's printed on both sides of the paper.  Though the paper is fairly thick (and accepts watercolor pencils), there's still bleed-through with markers and some pens.  It's not a bad coloring book, certainly not the worst I've seen, but not quite what I was hoping for.",3
"PROS:
- Beautiful , peaceful, serene, drawings and designs.
- Great activity to get you mind to a better place.

CONS:
- Most of the spaces that require coloring-in are way too small to use color-pencils with so I had to use colored pens.",3
Nice notebook would be better with alphabetical tabs.,3

"My daughter would give these a five star, I am sure of it. She was so excited to receive them. She immediately opened them to smell with me, but I found it hard to distinguish more than just a sweet scent from some of them. She assures me that each smell is unique though. They do write well and the glitter is definitely easy to see. I think after a month of coloring though the are starting to be used up. For the price, I think you could probably find a nicer set if you were willing to sacrifice the whole smell thing.",3
"Pretty colors and they smell fine, but they don't write too well. There's limited fluidity in the ink and that frustrates young children. It frustrated me.",3
My only issue is these pens Don't color in a rainbow blend of colors. I tried to get the pens to blend the colors but only two worked as stated in discription of them.. The pastel color is soft looking.,3
Not what was expected,3
"good idea, but the colors are runny",3
"When it's summer, my kids are always playing outdoor activities. So when we have the occasional rainy days, I have to come up with some fun activities that we can do inside. That is why I bought these pens, because they looked liked fun. There is a variety of 6 bright pens that color really well. They have not used them enough to see the colors change as they are using them, but I think that is a great idea. They used these pens for coloring, scrapbooking and just drawing fun pictures. The pens are supposed to smell fruity, like orange, lemon, grape, strawberry, apple, and cherry, but I was very disappointed because they didn't have any smell at all.",3
"the set I got for a friend she really liked and used right away and they do smell like you say of each color, but the one I got me the orange one after only  I used a few times it  changed colors I haven't used the others yet.",3
I purchased these because I enjoy using gel pens. I was disappointed that they do not write very smoothly and that the ink takes a while to dry.  There is more smudging that I would like and the pen catches while writing.  I did enjoy the nice vibrant colors and the variety of color choices.,3
"Not solid to write with, but fun for kids and their fuzzy posters",3
"but they point widens after use and the gel gloops out rather than being one smooth line. I was happy with them at first, but now with use...not so much. Don't know if they have a scent or not, haven't noticed one and it is not important.",3
Pictures I have seen on previous yearly Calendars so it was not as good a buy as I thought.,3
"I wanted to love these! While I do like them, they didn't quite meet my expectations on all counts.

Though my first grader son isn't homeschooled, he's quite ahead of his grade. We do a lot of educating at home to supplement the classroom so he stays challenged. I was particularly interested in these books because I grew up in Kentucky and missed a lot of the California state history. I thought these would be great for us to learn together.

I think they WILL be great... eventually. The description seems to imply that these are good for a variety of ages, but they are just not geared toward a kid of his age. I would say an advanced third grader. It's actually less about the difficult of the prose, and more about the violence and dry nature of the material. It was a bit much for my kid. He alternated between bored and horrified when we read it together. I finished them on my own and found them very informative for my own knowledge.

I also think these are quite worth the price. I expected them to be bigger or hardcover for that cost. However, they are slim paperback booklets. Overall, interesting and accurate, but not quite what they could be.",3
"these booklets contain lovely, colorful illustrations. Each of the six runs 32 pages long and includes a table of contents, index, read and respond section on the interior back cover and helpful glossary. The topics are California's Spanish Missions, Trails to California, Exploration of California, California's Indian Nations, Mexican Rule of California And Junipero Serra, a Spanish Missionary. The writing is appropriate for elementary school children. Unfortunately, just like the news this is not an objective telling of history. The main message is the Indians were treated unfairly, badly and wrongly. Maybe true but that is one part of history. the books are repetitive and frankly are not worth the asking price. Nice little paperbacks with politically correct content and lovely illustration.",3
"I already had the file folder. The design is so elegant and looks like embossed leather. High quality product and worth every penny. I will love using this every time I look up a phone number.

update: If you want to put even a few  papers in it - like a sticky note or dr appt card, the book won't close.
Also, the alphabet tabs are not practical, making it a little chore to find the right page. Although I loved the look I never used this and went to my shabby old one.",3
work well,3
It is OK but be warned the gauge of the metal is a lot thinner than I thought it would be and the white is more a light cream so it is not as good a match to my cook top as I hoped..,3
"This stuff does the job, but there is no applicator in the lid.  That means you will have to designate a brush in your collection for use with this stuff.  I used a disposable as I don't want the hassle of trying to clean a brush after using this.  The pick-up tool is somewhat usefull, but as long as your fingers are clean, you can rub off the frisket when your project is dry.  I used a heat gun to spead up the drying of my project and this stuff held up well to the extra heat.  I applied this to pain water color paper and also to water color paper that I had already painted.  It worked as expected in both applications.",3
"Good page markers, although a bit small for my arthritic fingers. I really like them 'cause they do a good job of keeping a page and they'll make a good gift - think about Christmas stocking stuffers.",3
"I really wanted Celtic designs, and these are cute work pretty good as bookmarks (just make sure to clip a few pages - I ripped a page because the paper was too thin, as compared to the strength of the magnet). I just wish that I didn't have buy eight because they're a bit expensive for what they are.",3
"I like the size and peacock feather design of this address book, the only thing that I don't like is that the letters are sectioned into pairs (AB, CD) instead of individual sections (A, B, C, D).",3
"It is a nice little Book. Measure the size. My main complaint is that the Peacock design is very dark - unlike the picture shown. You can only really see the cover design if holding it up to the light on an angle. Too in-expensive to return, and it is fine for my Passwords book.",3
"Nice cover and outer appearance but the paper inside isn't the best and has similar quality as wax paper. Still, the cost is cheap, and it works as a notebook for classes, so if you're not expecting much or not doing any serious drawing, then this is fine.",3
Very weak magnet.  Had to return it.,3
"2012 Calendar: Dilbert (Kindle) / B005VSRKR2

I love the Dilbert calendars, so this seemed like a great deal for a dollar. And... it kind of is. You get a year's worth of comics (although Sat/Sun are combined into one comic, but it kind of makes sense for a ""desk calendar"" situation), and they're the usual pretty funny Dilbert package.

My only complaint is that the comics are kind of tiny and low-quality and they don't zoom cleanly on my device. This is strange because the surrounding margins are large enough that the comics could have been made a little larger. And I get the comics sent to my home email every day and they're always bigger, clearer, and cleaner than these. So I kind of feel like maybe they skimped a bit on this Kindle version.

Here's hoping 2013 will be better with our enlightened future technology.

~ Ana Mardoll",3
"I buy these for my dad every Christmas, and he loves them. Unfortunately, this calendar was missing pages. I bought from a different place this year to make sure that didn't happen again.",3
"What is wonderful about this collection is the choice of strips and that they are color versions.
What is poor is the layout.
Given the dimensions of the calendar page and te fact that all of the strips are the same four even panels a 2x2 layout would have been logical and made for easier reading. Instead the layout is lazy with all four, tiny panels stretched across the top third of each page, te middle third blank and the bottom third displaying the same picture of Linus and Snoopy every day.
Poor.
Difficult to read but, if you have your reading glasses on, the strips are classic and worth a look every day.",3
Love the fun style but this calendar is so big Ive no place to hang the wall size art. Guess I missed the size info. Darling but huge. Pity.,3
"I read the reviews and was okay with it being a book of the same page over and over, that's kind of what a planner is.... but my beef is the web site that I am supposed to go to, to print additional pages etc.  doesn't work.  It takes me to a go daddy site.",3
My wife gave it to me as a copy.  It reminded her of our travel with goats in Turkey.,3
"Cute pics but doesn't include information such as all holidays or moon phases like most calendars. For instance, St. Patrick's day is not included but I see most other major holidays.",3
Doesn't fit over all school doors to hang things on,3
This boarder was fine but our school colors are red and black and this isn't a true red.  To me it's more of an orange red.,3
narrow,3
Good for bulletin board lettering but not quite big enough for an alphabet,3
Cute but some letters there was only 1... While others (that I didn't need) were 4+ of,3
"These do not have much more resilience than card stock.  They are flimsy and not likely to last as anything other than a decoration out of reach of most small hands.  They are bright and sparkly.

However, laminated, they would make fun labels for writing on and name tags and all the things in the product description.",3
"Because of the white background color of the Amazon page, I thought the medium and larger stars were just the outer ring. It makes sense that they have a white center, so you can use them to put names on. There is no sticky backing, you will need to tape them up. The name of the stars is misleading. There is no sparkle on these stars, No glitter, no reflection except on the gold portion of the stars. The stars I received had different colors on the stars than pictured here. The mid sized stars were ""rainbow"" the larger ones were a darker blue. The back is completely white, so you could have a project where the students fill in the back of the star themselves.

Really, there is nothing particularly great about these stars. The cut edges are good, the gold is shiney...You could use them for nametags etc - but for ""sparkle"" look elsewhere.",3
We are in March  and I have only liked January's saying so far so ripped the others out.,3
OK.  Do not refer to it too much.,3
Distinguishing office tool.,3
Good but after open and close....unhooked of spiral,3
liked this but need more line and square room i just don;t write that small,3
Cute and good if you only use them on one page at a time because they aren't very strong.,3
I love the colors but these are just too heavy for the page,3
"I think I expected it to hold like a strong paper clip.  It doesn't.  But, its great for marking your page.  I won't repurchase, but I won't send back either.",3
"These are clever, but function is average",3
Odd design.,3
"The calendar itself is funny, no doubt. But the paper stock used for this leaves something to be desired. When I hung it on the wall, the top corners curled slightly inward and I could not get it to lie flat. It looks a bit cheap which is too bad because the quotes and images are hilarious. Don't think I would order this again.",3
I think these are pretty good - some of the reviewers didn't give enough credit. However I rated it three stars because it's really not safe for work if you're in a conservative office environment! A lot of sexual innuendos (or just blatant sexual content...really) and what not.,3
I didn't really love the quality of it and the letters came off very easily i returned it and amazon costumer service helped me.,3
"Nice book mark but some of the printing rubbed off on the plastic shipping wrap. I kept it anyway. Looks better then picture because it has shine and a nice quality, too bad was slightly damaged in transit.",3
Bookmark looks cool. But the braided red rope on the top ruined my book. Its tainted red color marks and stains the pages red. Only use the cardboard bookmark and remove the braiding rope,3
"not very good, so large",3
Bookmark is pretty but the moon was almost all scratched off and the string was practically all unravelled the first day I got it.,3
Pretty bookmark.,3
"I thought this bookmark would be amazing...the picture looked like it.
It is nice, of course if you love wolves (and I do).  It just falls a little short for the price.",3
"I love this bookmark and would have given it a perfect 5 stars except for the fact that after just a couple of uses some of the ink started to come off the lettering which means a few of the words are starting to lose letters. The price on this bookmark was very reasonable though, so I would still recommend it as a cute bookmark that is worth the purchase - just be aware that the lettering may get a little messed up if yours has the same issue mine has.",3
The packaging around the spiral could be better quality,3
Work,3
"Cute but the double spiral makes the pages catch- - this makes the pages hard to turn, and thumbing through your addresses becomes a chore.  I'm sorry I purchased this.",3
It's actually quite nice in both size and thickness but the front cover has a ding in it and the very first page looks like it has a coffee stain on it - I removed the soiled page because it wasn't needed but I'm a bit disappointed in its condition.,3
"right price, who cares about the colour, for those days when the electronic book is buggered!!!!!!!! old school back up!",3
Small and pages stick together.,3
I didn't really like the way this address book was organized. It was okay.,3
"I truly like this book and use it quite regularly; however, I noticed about a month and a half after purchase that the front pages started to come apart, etc.! The best thing I can say about it is that I am happy it had that side attached rubber band to keep it closed so the ps ages didn't fall out whil I was awaiting a more sturdy one!",3
"Not a lot of pages, but okay for most important numbers since we're in the age of technology I wanted an old school phone book.",3
It works but very small.,3
This is just fine for my needs.  Very happy with it; very durable as well.,3
One address book is about the same as the other but this one is okay and actually I like the small size for home use.,3
"It's the perfect size for me, but the address spaces are very small.  I can hardly get the names and addresses/phone number from overlapping.  Maybe if you write real small naturally you will be happy with this book.  I will deal with it, but wouldn't buy it again.
Otherwise, the quality is very nice.",3
"I love the spiral bound pages, and the elastic strap that holds the book closed. Number of pages is great. My only complaint is that each line on the page is really small, so you need tiny handwriting to fit.",3
"Not what I was looking for, but it's still nice. I switched to an app for my smart phone. Now I have all my recipes with me wherever I go. Grocery store last minute? No problem. Friends want a recipe? Email it right from my phone. I'll never go back!",3
"This map is beautiful and I would give 5 stars except that it arrived with a crease in it as if someone stepped on the shipping tube. The top edge is a bit jagged as if someone crammed the cap on too quickly and with force. Other than these flaws, the map itself is a beauty.",3
"The map itself was as expected, a big laminated poster...but amazon just tossed it in a box and it was crushed when it arrived.  The whole map was covered in creases.  But I purchased this your my young child so they didn't care about the creases as much as I did.",3
"Thin and not easy to read if you are more than 6 inches away -- but as a decoration, it's decent",3
"I love this map. It is beautiful, the colors are subdued and gives you a warm effect looking at it. It would be suitable for hanging in an executive office. The downside is the very thing laminate that is on the map. I used a thumb tack to hang it on my office wall and when I pulled it tight the paper and laminate ripped right through. So its really not very durable. But it is very pretty and a good price.",3

More pictures than explanations.,3
This is just messy.....there is little ill be able to use here..id give it 2 stars but I will use it ..it has quality material for pages and a nice size...its just got too much black in the pictures for me and they are so messy....I don't like it...she does give you all the art lessons you need in order to make a quality painting on a page or something to hang up which is a plus if you don't no the lingo already..she covers that very nicely her style is just not for me...not to say its not good for others.....,3
price could be better,3
"i have read it and the contents inside few are useful, funny, okay, i already know, lame, dosent make sense or just bad....
so i don't really know what to say about it either than its okay... but i wouldnt recomand it to others nor would i be buying other versions of this books...",3
it arrives om time and it is cute,3
The mouse goes on it.,3
"It's a fun idea. My roommates love finding them around the room, but the adhesive isn't very good. They don't stick for long.",3
Good. But I never use it.,3
Pay attention to the size. This is a VERY SMALL note pad.,3
"I love how cute these notes are, but they do not stick! They only adhere for a few seconds before falling off, no matter what surface I stick them to. Its disappointing.",3
Its okay,3
I have always been a fan of the Knock Knock meal planning pad but we don't seem to be using this one as much. Most of their products are fun but not so useful. I do like the heavy magnet that keeps it attached to the fridge and it is a high quality paper.,3
"I really like this company and the product concept,

but the lines should have been colored a bit lighter.

Hard to read letters written in black or blue.",3
ok,3
"This is a great item EXCEPT: where is Saturday and Sunday since that is still part of the week. .duh....
It does NOT stick to anything, has no sticky back to it as I hoped it would. ""THIS WEEK"" . If it had both of these I would give it 5* but since it doesn't it gets 3 *.

I would not buy it again since its missing Saturday and Sunday and is not sticky on the back.",3
"Cute, but really overpriced.",3
No Saturday or Sunday (I though that the weekend would be the 6th slot). It's nice enough but I couldn't find one with all seven days of the week (which I need - I'm list obsessed or I'll forget everything). No magnet backing to put it on the fridge - ugh.,3
"Visually they are cool little notes.
Unfortunately the sticky side is lacking, and my notes fall within a couple hours of sticking them.",3
Two were bent but item is O.K........,3
"These are funny and have alternate meanings for the title letters.  They make a good gift for a laugh with an office coworker or spouse.  I do think they are WAY over priced but got them anyways for the laugh.  The laugh was also on me because some how I ordered two of them at full price.  Just sticky-notes with a catch-your-eye phrase at the top.  Not bad, not great but no need to get two sets.",3
Not thrilled with these but they're fine.,3
they  are adequate but they are not as cute as I had originally thought,3
Cute but sticky not very good;  Not like post-it notes.,3
Goof office present but a bit small and limited quantities of pages,3
I bought for a bad santa gift with pens that were shaped like matches. It was funny. But just okay. I wouldn't buy it again.,3
"We got this book because we say it in a store.  Although its a cool book, its kind of nasty when you think of it.  And its a big over priced for a blank book.  Makes a good gag gift.  Nobody in our guest bathroom ever signs it!",3
Cute but kind of useless unless so many people borrow books from you that you can't keep track.,3
Good for the younger set. Won't replace texting.  An adult version would be fun. Good back to school item for lunchbox notes.,3
Good to keep track of your books.,3
"I thot they would be bigger where u could write a short little note or letter  but they are simple post-it notes for one or two line sentences, etc. I guess I didn't understand the description very well.",3
"Honestly, this product is just okay. The price keeps changing dramatically (I bought it at around 14$, and now its at 9$). I would say it may be worth 5-7$. The book is VERY tiny and it has 50 ""fill-in"" pages. There were a few pages where I felt I could really personalize it, but I found myself rewording many of the prompts in order to not provide a generic answer that could be applicable to all moms vs. something unique about my unique relationship with my mom. Overall, this is just okay. I bought one for my dad at the same time too in ""diary"" format with this being ""hardcover"" and they look exactly the same. Just not a fan of this. I'd give it 2.5/5 stars, but since I can't, I'm rounding up to 3.  Next time, I'll just make something by hand.",3
"not really appropriate for legitimate self therapy or a gag gift.  They're not terrible, but if they changed just a couple of sections they'd be awesome.",3
Helps coworkers get though tough days.,3
I love the content but like all the other posters of it's kind it doesn't come laminated and it is just regular poster paper and easily torn.,3
"It's ok for the price, but not very sturdy.",3
meh,3
its okay. i had to laminate everything because the material's quality is not strong and long lasting.,3
Looks pretty.  But didn't last long.  Ripped too soon.,3
"I am a fourth grade teacher, and in past years I've always written the daily schedule on the whiteboard and just changed the few things that are different each day, like special areas or early dismissal days.  This scheduling pocket chart seemed like a great way to show our daily schedule because the students can see the time for each activity on the clock, and it also frees up much-needed whiteboard space.

Overall, it is a good product.  The pocket chart itself seems well made, and the card inserts are colorful and glossy.  The pocket storage at the bottom is useful for those cards you aren't using that day.  For these reasons, I like the product.

There were a couple of things I found disappointing though.  The first was my fault for not thoroughly reading the item description, but the second I feel should be corrected by the manufacturers.  So first, there aren't nearly enough cards for the way the students' schedule changes from day to day.  I barely had enough cards for one day of activities, and after I made cards for the different special areas, I had to make color copies of the blank cards and get them laminated in order to fully use the chart.  I do wish that more cards came with this, but the number of cards was clearly stated in the product description so that was my fault.

Another disappointment was that when you receive the product, the cards are all together on one large page, and they are NOT perforated for easy separating.  I cut them with scissors, and of course I'm not happy with how uneven I cut them.  I would have been happier if these cards were either perforated, or they came already separated so that teachers don't have to use rulers and make sure they are cutting evenly.

Also, these are laminated so that you can write on and wipe off if you'd like.  However, I found that if you do that, as soon as you put the card into the pocket, it rubs against the plastic material of the chart and smears.  If you don't want smears, permanent marker seems the only way to go.  Since I used permanent marker, I can only use these cards for one year, as I'm sure my schedule will change next year.  I can always reuse the pocket chart for other things, unless the card inserts are sold separately.",3
"This is cute, however I expected it to be more of a notebook from what the other customers were saying in their reviews, and it's really just thin pieces of paper. $3.00 is a little overpriced. Something that could be found in a dollar bin somewhere.",3
Good but thought it's write and wipe but it's simple rectangle white paper!...expensive,3
"Great idea, but these peel the pain off the wall. Can't use them that way. Had to purchase extra boards in order to use them",3
"We would do most anything for our kids, and this was a desire by one of our children- this was the least expensive way to get a copy of Jesus by Akiane.
So I closed my eyes and pushed- buy it with one click, and never looked back.  Jesus gazes lovingly at us, and you get 8 cards to share, or place somewhere to feel His presence.",3
Weird conversational tone...,3
"I got these for a principle appreciation day. They were good quality. The description was terrible tough. I thought I was getting 42 pages  with 4 handprints on them equalling 168 hands. Nt the case thought, there are just 42 handprints.",3
OK This is nice but the dimensions given in the product details is way off so larger than I expected but going to make it work.,3
Just okay.,3
"The cards are not laminated, but it's a good size",3
ok,3
"I was very excited to receive the item.  Unfortunatelly one of the folders was broken,  I suspect I received a used package  :(  I can still use the broken folder, but it's very dissapointing to receive something like that.  On the positive note:  i love the designs.",3
Seem small and only 8 plates. Like the design though.,3
"Once attached to the wall, this paper towel holder doesn't work as well as I'd hoped.  The part where one sheet is threaded through (to dispense just one towel at a time and make it easy to tear off) doesn't stay threaded - the towel usually tears off behind that part.  Also, pulling on the towels kinda shakes the whole unit a bit - being a little noisy and probably hard on the wall as well.

You should also note (as I discovered too late) that the holder only loads from one side, therefore I wasn't able to place it in the same location over the sink to the side in matching restrooms or I wouldn't be able to get the roll on and off once it was hung.",3
"I'm afraid this one is more form than function. It looks really nice in my kitchen since it is chrome. It mounts nicely to the wall. However, trying to pull off the paper towel is always a challenge. And it doesn't matter what brand paper towel I buy. You are supposed to put the paper towel through the opening then pull, but that never works. Instead, I just keep the bar over the top and pull the paper towel that way. Not bad for the money.",3
"Pros:
1) small enough to carry anywhere
2) strong gripping power
3) sturdy steel tools
Cons:
1) painful when squeezing hard on the pliers
2) tweezers have poor gripping power
Findings:
  I will stick with my Leatherman Squirt P4",3
This Is a set of very thin feeler gauges. They came covered in oil so be careful how and where you unpack them. Due to their extreme thin make up they are easily bent but handle them nice and they should last for many years.,3
"I had hoped these napkins would be the color of a Sunkist orange, as they are on my monitor. Instead they are a bright, intense, orange. I'd suggest they be renamed ""bright orange"". Great for Halloween, but not my purposes.",3
"A little boring for this age group, but does what it says.",3
"I gave it to my daughter, so I don't know how good it was.  I would expect her to like it.",3
"I love that the spout has a cover, but be sure to buy extra caps because the rubber o-ring will eventually loosen and it's difficult to get it back on (took me 15min and I had to use a spoon to hold down one side while I pressed in the other side of the ring). Luckily you can go to the Contigo website and they're only $5.",3
I loved the saying on the cover & wanted it as my journal. I started writing in it but have been noticing the pages are not staying well at all. Hopefully it won't all fall apart.,3
"Pro - Spill proof.
Iffy - too big for a regular drink holder.
Con - I have to turn the lid 1/4 turn to release the pressure.

My intention was to make it so I can drink while driving & not get pulled over for distractive driving.
A regular water bottle I can put between my legs & unscrew the top & ta-da. With this one, you need 2 hands as the seal is very snug which prevents leaks. Once it is open, I turn half way so I can drink as if I were drinking a fountain drink.
A lot of times, now I've had them a long time, the spout is slow to open & sometimes just releases & I have to use my finger to open the spout.
Despite my best efforts, cleaning of the lid is not as easy as it sounds. I won't get in to the details but my opinion I would avoid the HOT water...it messes with the seal & sometimes it comes off & can be challenging to put it back in.

Good concept but I would think twice before I buy anymore.",3
"too many tiny pieces for my old eyes, but really well made.  Will make pretty ornaments.",3
"I like this soap. It foams well on a luffa and smells great. The smell does not linger at all, unfortunately. You will just smell it in the shower. Bummer.",3
"I have used a Mom's planner before and I am  happy with this one but not quite the same.
Wish stickers  were LARGER. TOO SMALL FOR MY FINGERS.",3
"I was so excited to find something with a stay cool handle to heat up my lunch in the microwave.  I love the blue color and vented lid!  But... like everything else I've tried, it got that nasty stain ring when reheating a tomato-based stew.  The paperwork that came with it warns of staining, but I wish I had known that before paying $13 for a plastic mug!  At least it didn't blister like other containers.  Perhaps it should only be used for ramen, but I cannot speak to that because I haven't cooked noodles in it.",3
"The other cup was not in stock, but they sent me the one.  I  tried to contact them again and again and they did not respond.  So I coudl not give the pair as a gift as I had planned,.  They still advertise that they have the other cup, but they finally told me that they do not have it.  Yet the add remains that they do.  I wasted my money.",3
"The assembly of this unit was a bit difficult as the rods needed to be screwed together and they were not machined in such a fashion to make this and easy task.  I had to use vice-grips to get them tightened and this marred the finish on the rods.  This is not a horrible thing as, once a hose is hanging there, nobody will see the damage.  Like most such items the mounting screws were designed for a wood frame house.  I think there are at least three of these in Florida.  There used to be more but the last hurricane wiped them out.  For concrete block mounting you will need your own hardware.  I use a combination of standard wall expansion anchors and Tapcons.  I chose this type of hanger over some of the others as it allows me to grab the entire coil of hose and just lift it off in one motion for use.  I have the hanger at the edge of my garage behind a short hedge.  It holds about 25 feet of hose and could easily accommodate much more.
Basically this is attractive enough if you aren't hiding it behind a hedge and it is strong enough for its intended purpose once you manage to get it assembled.",3
I dunno. I thought Leatherman was supposed to make good products. It is difficult to open and I've pinched myself. Might just donate it to a homeless person.,3
a lot smaller than I was expecting. but they served their purpose.,3
it's o.k. but smaller than expected.,3
Had to order 2 of these in order to post all of the standards for the day.,3
This is a great concept & nice to have to standards right there ready to display. The only complaint I have is the font size is VERY small.,3
This is a great resource for posting standards daily. I like that they are easily filed away and assessable with category dividers. The only thing I would like to see changed is a larger font for reading ease.  It was also noted on my observation that my standards were too small.,3
It's too small to read from any distance! The cards need to be much larger. It is a great idea.,3
Best as a welcome to the class piece. Not very usable for behavior with a large class.,3
Used as part of my welcome back to school bulletin board.  Wrote child's name on each one.,3
I think that I must have missed the size dimensions when reviewing this product.  It was smaller than expected and so it didn't meet my needs.,3
"If that had been what I got. I got birds on my paper instead. It wasn't worth trying to return and get the other paper, it would have cost more to send it back. The birds are cute, just not what I ordered.",3
I think that I must have missed the size dimensions when reviewing this product.  It was smaller than expected and so it didn't meet my needs.,3
"Nice , good quality , pages turn well . Just your typical journal and felt it was overpriced .",3
A little small but pretty! I would rate it 5 stars but it came damaged. The pages in the back where slightly curved(bent) and there was imprints of something through the middle of the page toward the middle. Every page has a different verse for about 10-20 pages in and then it begins to repeat but you really can't tell. It has a place up at top to mark the date.,3
I give these out to new Christians for them to document their faith.,3
"Used with the ""Handwriting Without Tears Double Lined- Narrow"" writing sheets.  Would have trained the student on how to write clearly and precisely his words in cursive.  Teacher discourage the use of the book and paper.",3
"This would be a 5-star review if it were based solely on the layout of the content on the pages. Unfortunately though, the material on the outside of the journal has bubbles in it. Almost like the glue didn't adhere to the hard cover, or it got wet in shipping.",3
"These weren't as easy to read through the bright colors, as I had hoped for my daughter. She had major problems getting them off the paper they came on, as the color tabs came off WITH the paper. EEK! So I had to take over and handle them for her. I liked how their were extra tabs, like mpas and old/new testament, but wish they had been in a DIFFERENT color.

for the price I probably shouldnt complain, but.....had I known how aggravating they would be I would have spend the extra couple bucks for a different set.....",3
"You can find a comparison of these to their competitor (Tabbies), and why they are frankly inferior, hee: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/990049346X/ref=cm_cr_dp_cust_img_see_all_txt

Not all bible indexes are created equal. So I took picture s of these and others, side by side, for you to understand the differences that do not come out in the listings... And after all, isn't that what reviews are _really_ good for? ;)

Big Minuses: Too dark, square corners rip pages...",3
I found the directions to be too complicated and the application to be far too complicated as well if u place them wrong u risk ripping the page by trying to re-place them. Also they stick out of the bible on the side as well. I ripped probably 5 pages of my new bible :-( ultimately I got them placed but my bible is in rough shape as a result. There's gotta be an easier set out there.,3
ok,3
"The calendar has nice photos and the daily squares are just large enough to mark our appointments.  The paper is pretty thin, but acceptable.  I expected more astronomical ""fun"" facts to share with the family, so I am disappointed, as that is why I chose this particular calendar.",3
"These fit my students (preschoolers) rather well. I am disappointed in their size. I wish that the cake on the front was larger and sat higher than the balloons and presents.

 They're cute but I would NOT purchase again.",3
"It holds what we need it to (posters), but would prefer something a bit sturdier...maybe thick cardboard or something to keep it upright.",3
"It's ok for the price, but not very sturdy.",3
Used them as name tags for my students on the first day of school.  Cute.,3
"These are self stick, and are great for 1st grade. So why not 5 stars? The problem is when you try to take them off the desk. They come off in little tiny pieces. You literally have to scrape them off the desk. When you have 20+ to remove, it is a real pain. Not to mention that all the scraping damages the desks. Thank goodness we are getting new desks and chairs this upcoming school year, so it saved me a lot of time and aggravation. If you plan on laminating them first, it might work.",3
"I was looking for desk nameplates that would stick to the desks. I like the layout of these and the academic features/tools that are on the nameplate.. The only problem is that kids easily peel them, so I have quite a few that are sticking up on the edges or have portions peeled off. They work great for the kids that aren't fidgety and peel their nametags.",3
"I bought these for my niece but I tried them out first.  Other than the alphabet stamps the outcome of the stencil gives you a poor, ugly or unrecognizable picture.  I really expected better.",3
"So many choices of things to draw!  Hundreds of animals, plants, and other shapes.  Plus all letters and numbers.  Nice little case to keep them in as well.  I think you have to break apart the 24 stencil squares to fit them in the box at first (used them a year ago so I don't remember).  Not a big deal.",3
Very expensive for what it is.  Strange shapes which are difficult for child to identify.  Not worth the money.  Would return but for the expense of postage.,3
"A little smaller than i thought i read them to be.
Very nice paper and perfect size to carry with daily for jotting things down
only thing i do wish did not have numbers on them and not sure every single one needs all the xtra pages
with information that i do not need. Would have been nice if they would have taken those pages and made them blank or give more for the date pages to write on.

Love that I can keep them all together once they are done and be handy to look back over the year on.
They fit perfect in my small book i carry with me and can even fit it into my wallet that is bigger than a checkbook size.

To be clear this is not for someone who is used to a high tech way to keep track of your schedule or even for someone who has a very hectic schedule and you need to check very far into your year as you would have to carry around several of them to keep tabs on months ahead.

For myself i did not get these so much to use as a planner but more as a way to always have something with me for jotting down all those things my kids do and say that i wish i had record of as they are growing up far too fast and so many times i wish i could go back and remember something that was said. This way too i can look back at an entire year and see all the things we did together. So yes for my needs i guess will serve more as a daily journal than a planner.

Price I do not think that the retail listed is worth it but maybe if you have someone who is a writer or more on the artsy side or someone who still loves to take pen and paper in hand for their thoughts then when the price is under $20 might make a nice gift for them.

I also have to say if you are someone who is used to keeping track of your busy schedule on a tech device this is no way going to replace that in fact not even going to replace most designs of yearly planners but if you are someone who like myself is looking for a way to maybe jot down a thought or moment as you go through your busy life and want to one day look back at things that happened to your over the year then this is something you could use.",3
"but somewhat failed in execution. It is cute when it is all bundled together and there are very small monthly calendars for 2010 and 2011 in each book so you would have to use some sort of short-hand or use the notes section for planning ahead if you only carry one month at a time. Also mildly inconvenient to have to fill out your personal info 12 times instead of just once for a regular yearly/monthly/weekly planner. I usually program events on my cel phone calendar but still like to write things on a regular calendar but these are inconvenient to reference compared to a regular wall calendar. there is also a lot of extraneous information (for me anyway, I am not a jet-setter), I don't have much use for the travels planning/memo areas, time zones map, distances chart, dialing codes, conversions or international sizing chart. also has international holidays, but doesn't say what they are, just what country and what date. A very nice looking set, just not practical to me.",3
"I SEE THE PRICE IS GROWING AND GROWING!!!
IT STARTED FROM $13 I THINK AND NOW ITS AT 26 HERE ON AMAZON, HMM....

ANYWAY I CONSIDERED IT BACK WHEN IT WAS CHEAPER (AROUND THIRTEEN DOLLARS) ABOUT A MONTH AGO BUT I DECIDED ON A MORE PRACTICAL FOR ME FORMAT - THE LARGE MOLESKINE WEEKLY PLANNER - I THINK IT'S 10.85 STILL",3
"The problem with it is that it has to do better than just a plain old notebook or a plain Moleskine to be worth the purchase. You simply can't change this into another type of book.

For this reason - I would just stick to a regular old Moleskine for any and all of these ""passions"" series. The option to draw something or put in another note of a different type is simply worth more than the rigid attempt to keep you going in this (or any other) format.

The option is what keep notebooks and the Moleskine brand so high on my list. The option to put a random thought or a random picture in the book at any time is what makes this so great.

In my opinion they have put you into a ""corner"" with these passions books - and while they seem like a good idea, they kinda ruin the fun.

The most helpful feature of this book is the (too few) pages with note bars (not the technical term I am sure). It would seem to me that a musician or a song writer (who this seems to geared towards) would want more pages with the ability jot down a tune or write a song ....

Oh well - just get a regular moleskine with a rubber stamp of the bars to put into a blank page. Better options with that ... :)",3
"These Moleskin planners are very pretty if light on the space to put your content. Each month is a different colored little book which is just slightly thicker than a nickle. The colors are burgundy, red, lilac, pink, green, a neon yellowy color ( technical term!), teal, light blue, navy, deep blue, black, and finally gray. Apparently as the weather gets worse the planner colors get more boring. They come in a tough black cardboard surround with an elastic that wraps around the lot.

I've seen other reviewers say that the set was pocket sized and easy to put in your purse, which I can agree with if you are separating just a planner or two from the rest. But if you are actually planning ahead you likely want to carry at least several months worth together. Now, I have a big purse but if I were to put this into it the set would immediately sink to the bottom, get battered around, and way me down. If you don't keep them in the case they are small enough that you risk permanently misplacing them.

I think the set is more geared toward recording the happenings of your, or your families life for posterity instead of whipping them out to keep track of soccer practices and hair appointments. They would probably be a nice keepsake and far more practical sitting on a desk.",3
"In the age of Twitter, FlickR, and Google-mania, I didn't know that there was niche for printed daily planner book. However for those who still believe in old habits of deciphering daily activities in a note book, you are in luck, this is a color-a-month daily planner box that has 12 individual monthly notebooks packaged in a box. One page is designated for each day, and it is good for tracking personal activities. You can record New Year's resolutions, diet programs, achievements, and hobbies. Each notebook has a soft cover, which makes it light and easy to carry. Additional stickers and a color-coded flyer provide tools for easy customization.

I have been using online daily planners for the last five years, and I am quite happy with it. For me online calendars are easier to use and I need not carry with me",3
"This daily planner has a very nice feel, and the books are very high quality.  This is very old school.  I would recommend it for someone who does not use high tech devices.  Writers, people who use journals and enjoy writing in notebooks, and artists, might enjoy these planners.  This contains 12 individual monthly planners--one for each month.  Each month is a different color.  This is not practical for a very busy person.  I think someone who has a very busy schedule would get frustrated with this planner, but they probably use an electronic device.  This is very ""artsy."" It is good for either gender.  It's handsome and would make a good gift. It is small and would fit in a pocket.",3
"This is a nice notebook, well made and looks nice.  The utility of it is what I might question.  I am not a big wine drinker, I know what I like.  I took it to a wine expert and asked his opinion of the layout.  Wine should be an enjoyment, not a task.  There is value to this if one likes to write in a journal.  With all the available resources both in print and on line, there is not as much need for notes.  If a person is predisposed to maintaining a diary, then on a personal level this is a nice item.",3

"Shocked to find that these journals are so small.  The actual dimensions are not consistent with the size advertised.  The description says 64 pages measuring 5.7 x 4.1 x .5 inches.  According to my measuring rule, each one of the three-pack has 64 pages (32 leaves); each journal measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 1/8 inches.  Only if you put the three-pack together, then the thickness is a half of an inch.  Each one is actually one-eighth of an inch thick.  And they are definitely not 4.1 in width.

The item quality is good.  Until now, I could not imagine what I could use them for.  However, I just realised I could use one to record all of my passwords and other special information.  I will now have to look for some kind of disappearing ink so that my information can be secure if the journal is discovered by someone else.",3
"People often ask me what I like to listen to and why. I don't always have and answer.

This journal is organized in a that is part journal, part scrap book. I like this notion.

If I were very interested in sharing my thoughts and opinions on music, this would be an excellent way to track them and share them with others.

Sadly, I am not a music-phile, so this journal is more than I'd likely use.

"I thought that this would be a journal that had nice decorations on the front that I could write my lyrics in, but this is an actual Journal that you keep information of the songs you listen to and how they make you feel.  I don't need anything like that b/c when I hear a song I can go back to what made it memorable for me in the first place, with out a reminder.  I would return it but it has been to long!",3
"I love the paper quality of the Moleskine journals.  However, I felt that this Cahier Journal from Moleskine was lacking a bit in quality since the back pocket completely fell off from carrying a few of my class handouts--possibly the glue that held the pocket to the notebook was not strong enough and gave way once I started using them.  This happened in all three of the notebooks.  Furthermore, I do have to say that these are GREAT journals for college courses--they are great for note taking, and very easy on the eyes.  I honestly pride myself in my beautiful notes once I am done taking them because the paper allows for good calligraphy.  Again, my only complaint is that the back pockets are terrible.",3
"This is more of an bright orange color, I ended up returning it. And bought a black one.",3
"Not bad, but there's something about it that feels worse than standard Moleskines. Is it just me, or does the paper seem slightly heavier than a standard Moleskine? And the ruled lines are definitely darker to my eyes than the lines in notebooks I've bought from Moleskine that weren't address books.

I pictured it being like a standard ruled Moleskine with the added feature of alphabetical tabs. But it feels like the paper quality and ink quality (of the lines) is different. Is it just me?",3
Backing is not very firm for use as a reporters notebook hinged at the top.  Unlike other Moleskine notebooks that hing at the side giving the book some strength this pad is very flexible when you are trying to use it.  I can place some cardboard in the back pocket that might help.,3
"found the paper to be too ""waxy"" and lusterless to be useful as a true art Sketchbook.

When I draw nude [censored], I had a hard time configuring the overall shape on this paper.

I use Paper Mate Flair Porous Point Black Pens, Kimberly Graphite Drawing Pencils by General Pencil Co., Sanford Design Sketching EBONY Pencils and Colored Pencils for Drawing.

I also use homemade boar hair pen sets, using an old chicken bone and paint made from natural sources.

Moleskine Sketchbook Large isn't particularly great for any of these but I have a lot of pens to choose from and eventually I did find that the total package is very nice. It's wonderful to take along to sketch with some big marker even, or for anything else more serious, it's not as good.

Priced well here when on sale.

I love the feel of the premium Mole [censored] hide cover.

For a great artist Notebook, I'd get a Leuchtturm Plain Notebook instead.

The Leuchtturm Plain Notebook is equally expensive, or cheaper, as the similar Moleskine Large Sketchbook. The Leuchtturm Notebook looks nice and it has some much superior writer/artist Paper stock.

About 1/2 inch wider than the Moleskine, with a table of contents, numbered pages, and some cover and spine labels. The cover is not as oily either. The paper takes my pens/colored pencils/Drawing Pencils in a very agreeable manner.

Compared to the Large Moleskine Sketchbook (I found the Moleskine paper to be too ""waxy"" and lusterless to be useful as a true art Sketchbook), the Leuchtturm Plain Notebook is far superior. I'd go for the Leuchtturm Plain Notebook over the Moleskine since it has it has some much better Paper stock for Drawings, no annoying oily cover, and is 1/2 inch wider than the Moleskine.",3
"I did not know the paper was so thin.  I wanted to paint on it, and I can't. I would have liked to have seen the weight in the product description.",3
"Cover is flimsy, but my mistake for not ordering hard cover.  This is not the smooth paper, so be careful with you handlettering pens, this paper will tear them up",3
"It's okay, I wouldn't buy again the paper it too thin.",3
item is decent. I bought to use for water color sketches. It takes well to micron pens. Water color causes lots of buckling and warping. Pencil does not go on smooth. Really it is more for markers.,3
Moleskine weekly planners are a great idea. My major beef with this product is that it is definitely not fountain pen friendly. Bleed through is significant and pervasive. The paper is more suited for ballpoint use - but even then the paper is so thin that you will get ghosting on the backside of each page.,3
"I use this for military training and the product is OKAY. The cover is hard which means that when I stuff it in my pocket it WILL NOT bend at all, practically impossible. The pages are not super thing so it won't bleed through the pages unless you are writing with a thick sharpie. The pages are also yellowish but not too yellow that you cannot see the different colors that you write with.

One major flaw that makes me want to give this product three stars is that if you rip one page off ( which I often have to do) about two pages following will come apart as well because of the design. You have to struggle to rip that first page and you also have to be careful that you do not rip other pages because they are all binded together. If you are someone that also needs to rip pages to either photocopie or whatever then I do not recommend this product.
I still gave this product three stars because it is small enough to fit in just about any pocket but not too small that it is impossible for you to write on it.",3
"It's OK but paper is not great, fine if you only write on this one with ballpoints but if you use gel pens or fountain pens forget it! it suffers from show-through/bleed-through and feathering. If you really want a better pocket notebook try Leuchtturm1917, Rhodia, Word or Midori.",3
Just don't like the grid lines but that was my fault.,3
"I like Moleskine books and use a lot of them to jot notes in , but just beware that these are very small indeed.",3
Don't get me wrong. The quality is good but when I purchased the same books abut 2 years ago theRe were more pages. The older books are nearly twice as thick.,3
"How to describe this notebook? First, it's beautifully made, as Moleskine products usually are. The quality of the cover and of the paper is excellent. There are three different slender ribbons for marking your place(s), and I like the elastic band that keeps it shut when not in use. However... I deducted a couple of stars because of the way the interior pages are organized. I was expecting something like a regular journal, but maybe with some prompts or areas to write plant-specific notes, such as ""what's in bloom today"" or ""to do: needs transplanting"". Instead, it's split up into a lot of shorter sections, some of which make no sense to me. It'd be nice if there were a place (or a loop?) for a pen, so I'd have a writing implement handy anytime I picked up the journal. I've started using it for garden notes, and probably will use it to sketch out some garden plans. But I think after I fill this one up, I'll get a different journal and not re-order this one.",3
"I wouldn't buy again, paper is too thin.",3
"Kind of bummed that there's no ""month at a glance"" but is great for keeping your appts. And to do list organized. I believe I have been buying moleskin products for 8+ years and they truly are great quality.",3
"... you're not really the Moleskine demographic (as I said on my review of the Moleskine pen). But really, it works well as mechanical pencil and if you're dead set on buying a ~$15 pencil just because it fits on your hardcover Moleskine notebook (note: it does not work on a softcover notebook), then you'll make out fine. Still, I'd rather use an aftermarket pen holster like Quiver (also available at Amazon) which allows me to use my choice of pen/pencil and can be used on hardback and softcover notebooks alike, assuming you buy the $3 softcover converter.",3
"I like the color, but the pages are a bit too thin for my taste. I like to use pilot ink pens and it bleeds through which drives me crazy. I can only write on one side of the page, which is kind of a waste.",3
"I hate to say it, but the paper stinks. Worse than I remember. Maybe I got a bad batch, but Moleskine totally lost my business for cahier-sized notebooks... Even Field Notes blow this batch out of the water.",3
"It was alright and everything as describe. However, it didn't fit my needs once I got it. Amazon did wonderful in describing and representing it and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this notebook. I just needed something more and ended up giving this one to my daughter for her Bible study.",3
"I've heard a lot about Moleskines over the years, and they definitely look nice, so I picked a few up to write in with my fountain pens. Unfortunately, the paper is not well-suited to this at all, and virtually anything I try either bleeds to the back of the paper or can be seen on the back of the paper. I would recommend Moleskines only if you plan to write with pencil, because even using cheap Bic ballpoints or Pilot Precise pens, the paper is not opaque.",3
"For the price and aesthetic I don't think you can get many clean, simple nice quality notebooks like a moleskine. This was my first one I purchased and it turned out I use it less than my classes said I would, thats about normal though. However this notebook will last me until I fill the final page and then some. It is durable, I throw it, carry it in the rain, and whatever else happens on a daily basis. This is a good, however expensive, notebook/journal.",3
"The notebook is sturdy and light, perfect for throwing in your bag without taking up any space.  However, whether with a gel pen or some rollerball, there is too much bleed through.  Some people may not care and if I was writing a review solely for such people, then this would be 5 stars.  But if bleed-through bothers you, know that your ink will show on the other side, which may lead you to only want to write on every other page.  I've had better luck with Black 'n' Red notebooks and I will be returning to those.",3
"Good little book. The little cloth ribbon frays easily. Fountain pen ink bleeds through the back side of pages on which you write.

For mlitary folks: fits perfectly in your OCP sleve pocket.

Think I'll look around for my next notebook.",3
Not good for fountain pens. I will be buying Rhodia from now on.,3
"These notebook's I hear are the, ""cream of the crop"" when it comes to having a notebook to journal in.  This is my first Moleskin and it is nice.  What I like most is the quality of the paper.  However, there are other notebooks that are just as good or better and they include Typo's journal and the numerous custom journal's on Etsy.  Overall, the Moleskin is nice but I probably think twice before I buy another unless I got a good deal.",3
"The main problem of this is the thickness of the paper.
My fountain pens bleeds through them extremely easily. Not durable at all. Mine fell apart at the first leg of my trip across Eurasia, I had to (because I really like Moleskine) buy the A4 hardcover edition of this. The paper was thicker and the construction infinitely more durable.",3
"Damaged in shipping. Waiting on replacements. Quality of the actual cahier is a 5. No point in getting the lined, go for the graph. Perfect for sketches, lists, notes, etc.",3
"I'm a fountain pen user and, because I didn't read enough reviews, found the Moleskine paper to cause both bleed through and feathering with my FP. So that's on me but, for $20, I expected a better quality paper.

However, the primary reason I gave it just three stars is that after I took the plastic wrap off of the notebook, there was a really pungent smell from the book. I guess it is from the off-gassing from the glue they use but it was quite strong and unpleasant. That smell lasted about a week and was bad enough to cause me to rate it with three stars as well as switch to a different manufacturer.

So unless you're an avowed hipster who is obligated to buy Moleskine or risk losing your hipster card (as well as having to cut off your man bun and stop wearing flannel shirts), seek a better product like Rhodia or  Leuchtturm1917.",3
"Within the same order, I purchased a pocket sized ""ruled"" moleskine, a pocket sized ""squared"" moleskine, and a large sized ""squared"" moleskine.  Unfortunately, the lines in both the squared moleskines are too dark.  They are noticeably darker than the lines in the ruled moleskine (I compared them very closely to ensure that my analysis was correct).  Indeed, the lines are so dark that it's difficult to read what is written in black pen.  The only upside is that if someone is trying to read what you've written, over your shoulder, they will have a difficult time doing so.

This is unfortunate, because my friend's squared moleskine (which he purchased ""several years ago"") has lines that are much lighter in color, like the lines which appear in the ""ruled"" moleskines.  I'm guessing that I had a bum production batch, or they've amended the product from its previous form.

Also, with the squared moleskine, the lines are too close together.  They are closer together than the lines in the ""ruled"" moleskines.  This makes it difficult to write quickly if you're writing one line of text per line.  You have to write so small that it's difficult to keep up your writing speed.

Overall, a disappointment.  But generally I love moleskine notebooks.  Just sucks that the ""squared"" version (or at least the ones shipped to me) are so flawed.",3
"Hope this review is helpful to someone, as I've used reviews on Amazon for years to know which products I should purchase, so thank you review community!  For the Moleskine, I have several complaints because this is my first Moleskine product, and it so did not live up to the hype, or the price for the quality of the material.  First off, the paper is much thinner than I thought it would be, or think it should be.  especially for the price!  I bought these cahiers so as to have thinner books that, when combined, would add up to the thickness of the regular 240 page black notebook.  I should have bought the regular notebook, as these do not have the features of the notebooks - like elastic band or expandable pocket (though the cahiers do have a back ""pocket"" that is really a half-slit cardboard back).  The covers of the cahiers are just plain colored cardboard, and not nice at all - they remind me of the 2 pocket folders you buy at WalMart.  The most important, and worst, thing of all is the paper quality.  It is much, much thinner than it should be for the price paid.  I use a very fine tip fountain pen, and the paper does not pleasantly ""soak"" up the ink, AND the writing is very visible from the other side of the paper, making writing on both sides disappointing unlikely.  I have used a Standard Series Quill legal pad this morning, provided by my non-profit company - very inexpensive, in other words - and the quality of paper is comparable, in my estimation.  I will likely never purchase another Moleskine product, as other products I've investigated sound exactly the same (Piccadilly, CR Gibson Markings) at a fraction of the cost.  From what I understand, Moleskine has gone cheap on the quality but kept the cost extraordinarily high.  the greed of that business model is probably the worst part about this purchase to me, and I certainly won't support it in the future.",3
"This is my 3rd Moleskine.  While this paper takes fountain pen inks better than the Moleskine Sketchbook, the paper is inconsistent - some areas of the page will not take ink well (about 5% of a given page), while others will.  Very weird, and I wonder if this is a result of Moleskine moving their production to China.  I'll fill this one up, but I'm probably going to get something else next time as the quality has slumped a bit in recent years.",3
"most of my pens run on the paper and the paper itself is thin, but other than that I really like it",3
Love the book.  Don't like the elastic band that wraps around it.  I cut it off.,3
"Well it is kinda small for a $20 notepad.  I thought it was going to be bigger, but it is exactly the size stated (duh).  But with 3 months of Evernote premium included ($15 value) that makes is a $5 notebook.  Thus not really that bad a deal.  I haven't used it yet, so I will update about the writing / uploading experience then.  I use fountain pens, so I'm not expecting it to hold up too well based upon other reviews.  The top of the notebook got a noticeable ding in shipping.  I say in shipping, but I did not see it before it was shipped.  However the rest of the package and QC was pristine so surely it did not come from the factory like that.  That being said, it is nothing it won't get after 24 hours in my briefcase.  When opening the package you can tell the folks who make this really take this notepad business seriously.  All the corners, edges, bindings, stickers, etc. are perfect.  Somebody loved this notebook before sending it to me.  So I guess a little love is all you need to make it a good deal.",3
"I fell in love with using the moleskine cahiers as my journals for 2014. I bought some already (Moleskine Cahier Journal (Set of 3), Large, Ruled, Persian Lilac, Frangipane Yellow, Peach Blossom Pink, Soft Cover (5 x 8.25)) and LOVED them. Perfect size for me. I bought these to switch up the colors, but these are different. Not sure if I misread something in the description but the paper is much thinner on these. Even a regular pen seems to 'bleed' through to the other page. I already started journaling in this so I guess I have to power through, but I won't be using the other two in this set of three. It's okay for a notepad, but not for what I needed it for.",3
"I realise these notebooks are expensive and honestly, I took quite some time to actually order them, even knowing that it included three 'free' months of Premium Evernote.

In the end, I bought this note just for the premium trial of Evernote - I've been enjoying the free version for awhile and wondered if the grass was greener on the paid side of the fence.  Truthfully, not so much.

While the notebook has a cute Evernote themed design on the cover and it is a Moleskine, it isn't anything special.  It doesn't digitize written notes, it doesn't include any brackets to assist with camera lineup when photographing the page.  I could be using a piece of scratch paper and Evernote would still react the same to the notes written on it.

If you absolutely love Evernote and want to show off that you're willing to pay $20 for a notebook, then buy it.  But in the future, I'll pay the $5/month for Premium and use regular notebooks.

***UPDATE July 2014***
I happened to be on the Evernote products page of their website and see that they've re-designed the Moleskine books and now have Evernote Business notebooks that do include brackets for lining up the camera to photo the page.  This comes with a price tag of $33!!",3
"Very simple notebook with a trust worthy reputation. At least 10-15% more expensive than a non branded notebook, though.",3
"It's just a notebook using what used to be called phantom ink so you can take a picture of a page and import it into Evernote without seeing the lines on the page.  Who cares?  Plus, it's very expensive for what it is.  I wouldn't spend the money again.",3
"I got this pen when it was still metal (I guess they updated the Amazon listing -- this product is in my order history, but it clearly says ""plastic"" which it was not when I got it). It was more expensive than it was worth, but it is a pleasure to write with. All the Moleskine stores have the plastic model now which I really don't like at all.

The problem with the metal was that the paint did chip a little, though.",3
"After owning Moleskines in the early 2000's, I thought I'd return for another try, and I still don't ""get it."" This particular notebook is not very pleasant to write in (pages smearing, hand cramping near the edges of the first pages, etc). Still not super impressed for the price...",3
"This is a good notebook, so I can't really complain. My only issue is the price - I have found cheaper variants out there with identical quality. As long as you're OK with paying for the brand name, it will serve you well.",3
"After constantly losing post-it notes, I decided to buy a nice notebook in hopes it would encourage me to keep all my ideas, thoughts, and notes in one place. For how expensive the moleskin notebook is, I would expect to be wowed by it's quality. Overall, it's just so-so.

It certainly looks nice, however I don't understand the why people love these things. The corner of the front cover came bent and since it's just cardboard it'll never return to normal.

The pages look nice, but they are thin and while ink generally won't bleed through the pages you will clearly see ink from the backside of a page. This feels messy and makes it hard to write on both sides of the page. I am not using an overly inky pen, not nearly as bold as a G2 (I prefer the Uni-Ball Jetstream .7mm).

I also don't really like it not being spiral bound. The moleskine looks much nicer, but it's not nearly as pleasant writing on the left hand page due to the binding.

In summary, the notebook looks nice and is functional enough, but definitely not worth the money for me. It does not feel ""special"" in any way.",3
"I bought this book after getting some larger Moleskine lab notebooks.  The large books are made in Turkey, and have paper that doesn't bleed through when using a fountain pen.  I purchased this book thinking that the paper would be of equal quality, and was somewhat disappointed.

The smaller book is made in China.  The cover and pouch are of good quality, and the paper is very smooth to write on.  Unfortunately, it is also very thin.  Fountain pen ink bleeds through it slightly, and is clearly visible from the other side.  It's in the range of being tolerable, but shouldn't be an issue for the price that I payed for this journal.  I use a Parker Sonnet, with blue-black Quink, and the bleed through is pretty noticeable with it.  The Sonnet does write a bit on the wet side, so there may be some pen / ink combination that doesn't bleed through.  I am not in the market for a new pen, though.

I'm going to continue writing in this journal to see if I can tolerate the bleeding that is going on.  I'm not sure if I would buy this product again.  It's such a shame, too, as the form factor, look and feel are absolutely what I was looking for.  Moleskine uses better paper on their other models, as I have experienced.  Such a darn, darn shame.",3
"I love the color of the cover and the dot grid is great, but the paper is thinner than it should be.",3
"After recently switching to writing with a fountain pen, I found myself hesitant to buy this notebook. I had heard that Moleskine paper is relatively light and prone to bleeding and feathering. Using my Pilot fountain pen and Namiki (Pilot) ink I see that my fears were fairly unfounded. There is no feathering and little to no bleed through. I am writing on both sides of each page without much issue, though you can see a faint image of your writing on the reverse side of each page as you go.

The overall construction of the book is of good quality. The rear pocket has enough room for some additional loose bits of paper and the green band and bookmark are tasteful pops of color. Overall I'm fairly satisfied though the price seems a little high compared to other ""deluxe"" notebooks like the Leuchtturm 1917, for example. However, if you factor in the price that you are getting three months of Evernote Premium, that might shift things slightly- for those who use Evernote extensively.

The technological twist on this notebook is a bit of a novelty. It most likely will not change the way you take notes, or the way you use evernote, but it's an interesting experiment.",3
"dots are very light, making it difficult to see them.",3
These notebooks are neat.  Love that they come with extensions to the premium service online.  Wish it was a bit bigger.,3
"Nicely Bound, Cool Cover. I Bought This For My Evernote. It Made No Discernable Difference To Using A Regular Notebook And Scanning It To Evernote.  And I Cld Have Added $15 and Paid For 1 Yrs Premium Evernote Subscription Instead Of 3 Mths. If you Have The Disposable Income To Buy $30 Notebooks Its Ok. But Bang For Buck Its Not Worth It. Ill Get A Cheaper Book And Spend My Cash On My Evernote Subscription.",3
"I've heard a lot about Moleskines over the years, and they definitely look nice, so I picked a few up to write in with my fountain pens. Unfortunately, the paper is not well-suited to this at all, and virtually anything I try either bleeds to the back of the paper or can be seen on the back of the paper. I would recommend Moleskines only if you plan to write with pencil, because even using cheap Bic ballpoints or Pilot Precise pens, the paper is not opaque.",3
It's not what I expected.  Hard to write on the lines and on back of page,3
"I use EverNote extensively, and thought that having this notebook would be a great addition. Well, for me, it isn't all that convenient. The notebook is well made, but so are other notebooks at a third the price! Unless you take lots of notes and need to have them scanned into EverNote, this notebook is not worth the expense.",3
"Overall, a decent notebook to use for Bullet Journaling. I like the dotted format more than graph paper or lines, as it allows clean layout but doesn't disrupt my doodling. I do end up playing games of Dots and Boxes with myself, but why not? The covers are durable, the elastic closure is vital for something that gets thrown in my bag, and of course the bookmark is fantastic. I keep stickers and small washi tape samples in the back pocket for decorating when I'm bored.

The biggest drawback to this Moleskine notebook, for me, is that the paper is too thin. Almost any pen I use shows through the back too much for my tastes, but my pen of choice, the Uniball Vision, is basically unusable if you plan to write on both sides of the page. I've taken to taping printouts on the reverse side of the page, or using Post-It Notes to add space. Because of this, I won't buy another unless Moleskine is hiding some heavy paper  version somewhere.",3
Ok for every day use didn't really like the cover or the color,3
The paper quality in moleskine has severely gone down. I pay $20 for a journal it should be top notch paper.,3
"I use this Moleskine Classic Notebook for a journal. This one is ""Dotted"" so you have some sort of guidelines for lettering or drawing. I LOVE the color. It is between an aqua and teal (Pretty spot on with the picture).

Previously, I was using the smaller black moleskine. This one is a bit more expensive (i am guessing because of the size difference) but I really was NOT pleased with the cover of the larger moleskine. If you want a ""tough"" cover do not get this one. It is VERY flimsy and makes me nervous since I use it as a mixed media journal. The ""String"" that bounds the moleskine also feels very loose on this size. Also, the paper has a lot more ""bleed-through.""

I still like moleskine products but I think I will be ordering the smaller size in black next time. At least now I am educated.",3
"I expected a lot more wow.
I keep hearing how wonderful Moleskine is and how after having one people won't use any other brand.
Maybe this was before they became mass marketed.
I was expecting the cover to feel wonderful or the paper to feel wonderful to write on - something different or amazing about it.
I didn't feel any wow.  Nothing special.  Just a notebook that costs a lot more than any other.
I guess it comes in a nice color.",3
"I definitely like the idea behind the Passions line of Moleskine's, but not entirely how this has been executed. The notes section is limited to a very narrow column on the side of the page, with one third of the main writing area being dedicated to quotes, and the other third one's review. A book of this sort would be better served by having at least two pages of data for each book. This would add to the number of pages in the book, but I think it would make the book much more useful.

I'm not entirely sure of the benefit of the book list in the back of the entries as well. What does that serve? That space could be better used for more book entries rather than serving as some sort of index I'll never use.",3
"I rely on both Evernote and paper systems so I was thrilled when Moleskine and Evernote began their collaboration. I rate this only a three because, for the price, the paper should be able to withstand fountain pens.  Leuchtturm notebooks have expandable pockets, page numbers, an index and phenomenal paper which can withstand ink, gel or marker. If I could combine those qualities with Smart Stickers I'd be one happy camper.  I purchased this set of Moleskines specifically for the stickers and would, obviously, pay a premium for the privilege of ordering them alone.",3
The black vinyl cover is separating from its paper backing within a couple of weeks. I like you can tear the pages from the notebook. For the money I think you can do better.,3
Nice book but not exactly for addresses - though it would work.,3
"I just purchased these moleskine set of 3 books on the upswing of finishing my first sketchbook. Altough moleskine has great quality sketchbooks and journals I'm not sure if I would purchase this set again. The pages are pretty thin so if you're thinking about laying down watercolor, heavy marker or washes it's a no go. I tried using both copic markers and they seemed to get sucked up into the texture of the paper and it wound up creating a textured look -- definitely not what i was looking for. For me the sketchbook seems to work best with pens, brushpens, pencil and color pencils.",3
"Eh.  They are not titillating. Nor even scintillating.  Not even especially inspiring.  Just Eh. I love it when a Journal makes me feel, Oh.
when I go to it, pick it up to write in it, that the pages welcome me to write, wait for me to write.  The feel of the cover under my fingers, the heft of the book, the peel back to find the next page, the sense of accomplishment of how much is already filled up.  But these 3 are sitting on my side table. eh.

I'm considering getting out a glue stick and stack of magazines and cutting images to glue to the covers; to keep an eye out as I read the newspaper for inspiring pictures or phrases or story bits; to glean greeting cards: I have a little pile of lovely xmas cards: and decoupaging the 'plain brown wrapper' covering these journals...

and then I think: maybe these are meant to be plain brown writing pages; a strip down to the bones kind of reflection; a stand back and just report the truth, no frills moment in life.

eh.

eh. to be continued, perhaps.",3
I love the binding the rounded corners the texture the durability.  But the sizing is really inconsistent.  This makes it hard to do flat washes as you get patches of white paper coming through where the sizing was too heavy.,3
"The paper is not thick enough to use both sides of it, which is a huge disappointment coming from Moleskine. I still like it, and is overall a really nice looking sketchbook, but I bought it to draw a storybook using both sides of the pages, which I am not going to be able to do...",3
Not enough pages.,3
"This paper is not the smooth paper, be careful with handlettering pens, this paper will tear them up",3
"I bought this because I love the size and was having trouble finding any other journals with the same dimensions (that also had what else I was looking for in a journal). However I'm very disappointed in how thin the paper is. I also already have pages falling out now. I've taped them down and just hope that more of them won't give me any problems. I'm not a fan but I found something to use it for. Just not originally what I wanted, mostly just as scrap paper. It does LOOK nice though!",3
fast work,3
"This is the second set of Moleskines I've tried, and again I'm disappointed that all of the pens I've tried using have shown through the back of the page, which makes it impossible to use both sides. Other than that I have no complaints; the notebooks are a GREAT size, and have a good amount of pages. Not too many, not too few. I intend to use them as travel journals and I think they're absolutely perfect for it. I REALLY just wish that the pages didn't show through; anyone have any recommendations for similar notebooks with paper that doesn't show pens through to the back?",3
"Book itself is very nice. The one we received was defective in that the elastic band broke upon the first use. Exchange was very easy, so 3 stars for that experience.",3
Tried to use these for college notebooks. I think you can do better for cheaper.,3
Very disappointed in the size of this notebook. It was advertised as one size but seems to be much smaller.,3
"I LOVE the 7X10 size, but would be perfect if it had the option of getting a hard cover with it.  They only seem to have larger or smaller sizes with hard covers but not these sizes.  Guess I'll have to stick with the unlined mead composition books which are close to this size but hard covered.",3
"I have bought 6, yes SIX, of these pocket size softcover ruled Moleskines from Amazon over the past month and 4 of them were excellent- smooth silky paper, tightly woven bookmark, 4 stitches in each signature...perfection. The other 2 were GARBAGE. The paper was rough and thin and so cheap! If you've never had a Moleskine before and don't know if the paper quality you received is what people rave about, here are two more indicators that you got a DUD; as soon as you take off the shrink wrap, notice the bookmark will already be fraying slightly on the end instead of being tightly woven, it will also be a shimmery lighter gray color instead of a dark charcoal color, and there will only be 3 stitches in each signature instead of 4 (meaning, open the book to the middle and count the stitches that you see). I didn't see the point in returning them since my husband isn't picky about the paper he writes on, so he was absolutely thrilled to take them off of my hands.

I should also mention, I ordered 2 large ruled softcover Moleskines in this same time frame and they were both duds too! I'm not buying a Moleskine notebook ever again. Too unreliable. And that's too bad because I love the size so much. It seems the only reliable Moleskine products are their planners. The paper quality always seems to excellent in those.",3
This is the soft cover version and not the hard cover. It is much less durable and harder to write in.,3
"Love the paper, hate the dimensions on this sketchbook. It's a little awkward to paint on because the size (REALLY long and rectangular) makes hand placement awkward. You get a lot of sheets for the price, but I would prefer a watercolor notebook with more standard sketchbook dimensions, even if it had less pages.",3
"I LOVE THE QUALITY OF MOLESKINE WATERCOLOR NOTEBOOK, BUT LETS BE HONEST IS NOT LARGE.  ITS AN EASY FIT TO TAKE ALONE WHILE TRAVELING.  HOWEVER, I WAS A LITTLE DESAPPOINTED WITH THE SIZE.",3
"Bought this book with some others to do travel painting.  When traveling in a car or on a bus or in a airplane, we want to take something with us to do some watercolor painting.  I have several of these and sometimes do several paintings a day.  I am now looking at using a larger size travel drawing and painting book.",3
I expected better from Moleskin.  The paper is light weight and ink bleeds through.  Impossible to use a fountain pen and almost as bad with ball point (Gel ink),3
"I love the paper quality of the Moleskine journals.  However, I felt that this Cahier Journal from Moleskine was lacking a bit in quality since the back pocket completely fell off from carrying a few of my class handouts--possibly the glue that held the pocket to the notebook was not strong enough and gave way once I started using them.  This happened in all three of the notebooks.  Furthermore, I do have to say that these are GREAT journals for college courses--they are great for note taking, and very easy on the eyes.  I honestly pride myself in my beautiful notes once I am done taking them because the paper allows for good calligraphy.  Again, my only complaint is that the back pockets are terrible.",3
"Same paper as regular Moleskine Journals, but with heavy Kraft paper covers.
I thought these wopuld be useful, bit I keep going back to my XLarge hardcover Moleskine instead.
If you are going to use them for special projects, these would be useful to you.
I believe they come in different colors also.",3
"The binding and cover are nice and they have that classic moleskine feel. The book lays flat when opened and I like the color of the paper and the gray grid. The paper is smooth and ink does not bleed through; the relatively thin pages have a ghosting quality that I think gives character to written pages. Travels well. I want to love them. But some of the pages seem to have a waxy residue on them that, although invisible, causes spots on the paper to be repellent so ink and watercolor not to adhere properly. I use this as a planner, journal, and sketchbook, so having consistent texture is a must for me. Because those slick spots are invisible, I don't know they are there until after my paint has pooled.",3
Very flimsy.  You'd be better off getting a hardback.,3
"I love these notebooks and have been using them for years in both the large and extra large sizes.
I've been using a fountain pen.  My notebook purchase I have noticed a difference in the paper that causes my fountain pen ink to run through the paper noticeably more than previously.  I've tested my pen on older notebooks and there is a definite change in the paper.
I hope that this is a manufacturing deviation that will be fixed in the future, otherwise I would rate a solid 5 stars.",3
"The simplistic design and color of these sketchbooks are very appealing, but these Moleskine Notebooks are very flimsy. Nonetheless, this is great for quickly writing down notes or for quick sketches.",3
"Not what I expected, but they are very austere compared to the price. I was expecting something thicker with interior folders on the back cover (typical Moleskine) with a elastic retaining band. Nope! This is a simple notebook at a higher price than is fair.",3
This is the first time I purchased Moleskine product and the paper is just to thick for my taste its like drawing or painting on cardboard maybe other type of papers like watercolor would be better but these are very expensive.,3
Not so great.,3
"The quality is good on these.  I thought I would save a little money by purchasing this style, however for the price it did not save much money as there are not that many pages in each item.",3
I thought that this was 3 of the leather bound Moleskine notebooks that I normally get but its not (snafoo on my part). I am going to use them anyway. The covers are a soft material but the paper inside is normal. They don't bleed that bad but if you are looking that won't bleed find something else.,3
This is a good notebook but the hard moleskin notebook just isn't as good as the softskin one I previously used.,3
"I ordered the wrong size. My bad, but find it difficult to use a book this small with a flexible cover. Overall quality is excellent, however.",3
"These are nice for a couple of reasons. First, they have removable pages (not all of them, but maybe the first half of each book has perforated, removable pages). I like this because if you just want to scribble thoughts into a normal Moleskine, it kind of wrecks the notebook if you rip out a page). They are thin and easy to fit in a pocket so you'll actually carry these around.

The downside is that they don't have the sturdy binding that makes a Moleskine a Moleskine. They are more like thin, regular notebooks. If you frequently lose your notebook before it's full, these would make sense. Similarly, if the size and stiffness of a regular Moleskine prevents you from carrying it around, this would be a suitable alternative.",3
"I've seen a lot of praise for the moleskine notebooks, but using one I'm a bit disappointed in some of the design aspects: binding that doesn't allow for flatter pages, no folder for receipts/notes, and paper weight appears to allow some bleed-through when using fountain pens (to be realistic, it could be the ink). Still looking for that perfect journalling notebook.",3
"I found the paper to be too ""waxy"" and lusterless to be useful as a true art Sketchbook.

When I draw nude [censored], I had a hard time configuring the overall shape on this paper.

I use Paper Mate Flair Porous Point Black Pens, Kimberly Graphite Drawing Pencils by General Pencil Co., Sanford Design Sketching EBONY Pencils and Colored Pencils for Drawing.

I also use homemade boar hair pen sets, using an old chicken bone and paint made from natural sources.

Moleskine Sketchbook Large isn't particularly great for any of these but I have a lot of pens to choose from and eventually I did find that the total package is very nice. It's wonderful to take along to sketch with some big marker even, or for anything else more serious, it's not as good.

Priced well here when on sale.

I love the feel of the premium Mole [censored] hide cover.

For a great artist Notebook, I'd get a Leuchtturm Plain Notebook instead.

The Leuchtturm Plain Notebook is equally expensive, or cheaper, as the similar Moleskine Large Sketchbook. The Leuchtturm Notebook looks nice and it has some much superior writer/artist Paper stock.

About 1/2 inch wider than the Moleskine, with a table of contents, numbered pages, and some cover and spine labels. The cover is not as oily either. The paper takes my pens/colored pencils/Drawing Pencils in a very agreeable manner.

Compared to the Large Moleskine Sketchbook (I found the Moleskine paper to be too ""waxy"" and lusterless to be useful as a true art Sketchbook), the Leuchtturm Plain Notebook is far superior.  I'd go for the Leuchtturm Plain Notebook over the Moleskine since it has it has some much better Paper stock for Drawings, no annoying oily cover, and is 1/2 inch wider than the Moleskine.",3
"they could have some more pages. it is a small notebook that fits into all pockets, although one probably couldn't write too much until they need a new one.",3
"Was planning to return this item because it is so small, but decided to keep it.  Will use to for travel and putting vip information in it.  Comes in two colors, the blue you see and the other one is a darker blue, which I like better.",3
"I'm not the world's biggest Moleskine cheerleader(I think they're a little overrated, and a lot overpriced). Having said that, these weren't  too hard on my wallet, and they fit nicely in a jackets kept, so good enough.",3
"I like using my phone for notes, but I've found that the process of launching into a note app and starting to type is not as efficient as using a notebook. Plus you can easily scribble a simple map or picture. These notebooks have some good features, but this is not a particularly tough little notebook. First of, these are nice, low profile books that easy slide into almost any pocket. Obviously only 32 pages (they count 64 front and back) isn't going to get you far if you need to take notes on a regular basis, but for a quick ""jot"" or occasional ""to do"" this is awesome.
I like writing with fountain(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilot-Varsity-Disposable-Fountain-Pens-Black-Ink-Dozen-Box-90010/dp/B001GAOTXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pens, Black Ink Dozen Box, 90010</a>&nbsp;or rollerball pens that use liquid ink, and the ink can bleed through the back of the page. however, this notebook so easily fits my needs and its design makes it easy for me to take along and not feel like I'm crowding my pockets. The final nice touch is the back cover that has a pocket to hold business cards or other small pieces of paper.",3
Thought it had lines not graph on each page,3
No index. I should've read the description closer. I will stick to my Leauchtturm 1917.,3
Very thin paper. Ghosting is a problem. How has this brand not improved the paper in their notebooks?,3
"Frankly, I like the Field Notes brand better.  The mail thing about this is there is no printing on the cover so I don't always know if I am opening it on the frontispiece.  Only by feeling the embossed Moleskin name on the bottom back can I sometimes tell if I have it turned to the front.

However, the paper is of excellent quality.  I use a fountain pen for notes and there is no bleed thru.

Like it but will stick with Field Notes for a small carry all quick note pad.",3
"I've been using Moleskin Plain Pocket Notebooks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moleskine-Plain-Notebook-Pocket/dp/8883701038/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moleskine Plain Notebook Pocket</a>) for years and love them. I decided to try a different variety when I saw ""Plain Reporter Notebook"" in the stationary store today. As a lefty, I like the idea of a notebook opening from the top. I just removed the shrink wrap and started using this new notebook and have to say that it is the first time I'm disappointed with a Moleskine product. The picture printed on the packaging shows the cover flipped over all the way to the back. This is misleading.

First, to flip the cover over all the way to the back requires some force and I worry I'll break the binding.

Second, half the pages in the notebook want to go with the cover. For the first few pages, you'll lose almost the top quarter of the page due to the paper bending over.

Because of these two issues, I flip the cover up, but not over, which is fine, but not what I was expecting.

Also, for such an expensive notebook, I hate to waste pages, but when using a flip-up like this, it is not convenient to write on the backside of the pages. You can use this note book horizontally, especially if on a table, but if you are going to use it horizontally, you'll probably be better off with the Plain Pocket Notebook.

This is still a nice notebook, but not what I expected and I'll probably go back to using the Plain Pocket Notebook after I fill this one.",3
"Within the same order, I purchased a pocket sized ""ruled"" moleskine, a pocket sized ""squared"" moleskine, and a large sized ""squared"" moleskine.  Unfortunately, the lines in both the squared moleskines are too dark.  They are noticeably darker than the lines in the ruled moleskine (I compared them very closely to ensure that my analysis was correct).  Indeed, the lines are so dark that it's difficult to read what is written in black pen.  The only upside is that if someone is trying to read what you've written, over your shoulder, they will have a difficult time doing so.

This is unfortunate, because my friend's squared moleskine (which he purchased ""several years ago"") has lines that are much lighter in color, like the lines which appear in the ""ruled"" moleskines.  I'm guessing that I had a bum production batch, or they've amended the product from its previous form.

Also, with the squared moleskine, the lines are too close together.  They are closer together than the lines in the ""ruled"" moleskines.  This makes it difficult to write quickly if you're writing one line of text per line.  You have to write so small that it's difficult to keep up your writing speed.

Overall, a disappointment.  But generally I love moleskine notebooks.  Just sucks that the ""squared"" version (or at least the ones shipped to me) are so flawed.",3
"This pen is a ""so-""so"" replacement for 4 pens I had which finally dried up and ran out of ink. The tips are ""fine"" enough but the colors simply aren't as vivid as I would prefer.
Even the black is not as dark as I was looking for, and the colors just don't show up very well. It is convenient to have four-in-one. I will keep looking, but this is acceptable for now.",3
It's okay I guess. You have to scribble though to get the ink flowing. each time you want to use any of the colors. I won't buy another one since the scribbling means you use up ink in the process.,3
The pen came dried up and did not work threw it out.,3
"I like to carry a notebook with me everywhere I go. For years, my notebook of choice has been Field Notes. I love their price, their durability, their light weight, and their small size. After awhile using the basic, craft paper Field Notes notebooks, I noticed that the constant wear and tear of keeping one in my back pocket all the time was crumpling these notebooks and ruining the craft paper covers. All in all, that's fine, because I don't much care about how my notebooks look. But since these leather covers are inexpensive, I decided hey, let's add a bit of class to the utility of my notebooks.

In terms of class, this was a good choice. The grain on my Flight Jacket cover is very tight, and the staining job is excellent. This easily looks like a piece of leather I might have paid twice what I did for.

Unfortunately, because this leather cover is supposed to *do* something, looks must come secondary to function, and that's where I'm having problems. These feature a large pocket on the inside of each cover, and the sole method of securing your notebook is inserting the notebook's front and/or back into these pockets. Therein lies the problem with Field Notes notebooks.

So your standard Field Notes notebook is made of paper. The problem with paper is that it's not very rigid, and trying to wiggle a craft paper cover into a super tight-fitting leather pocket is an effort against futility. The pockets just need to be a wee bit bigger. There's not enough clearance inside the pocket to ""wiggle"" the page in, so you're stuck trying to use rigidity tricks you might have learned trying to fit way more papers into your high school Trapper Keeper than it was ever designed to fit. As you probably remember from high school, those efforts occasionally resulted in disaster, like when you ripped a giant gash in your Macbeth rough draft. So far the lives of two very innocent Field Notes notebooks have been lost in the effort to tame this beast of a leather cover, and I can't help but wonder, o ye gods of manufacturing, what dark and terrible costs are brought by these covers that an extra 2mm on the pockets cannot be justified by the protecting of innocent notebooks!

Once you get your notebook securely fitted, the cover is great. It just sucks I'm made to dread the day when I will have used every last page in the notebook that's in there and be forced to replace it.

Also, the cover isn't pre-creased. When it first arrives, it's just a flat piece of leather with two pockets. There's an obvious reason for this, which is that the notebooks that it works with are all different thicknesses (so you need to be able to make your own crease), but it was kind of a surprise to me when I first opened the thing.",3
"This map is great size wise, we are using it for homeschool. I expected it to be laminated, it is not. it is very thin and even with a slight plastic coating tore easy. Great idea though. Will frame this and use it, but was not what I had in mind. Thank you",3
This planner would be perfect if it had a larger monthly planning section. One page per month would be perfect. The paper quality is wonderful and is very fountain pen friendly.,3
I wish the planner had retained the 2 pages per day.  I miss the daily journal section.,3

I'll give this a solid ""meh"" and look elsewhere for my next planner.",3

"I've had this type of planner before. I really like the design because there is space to put events, goals, etc. on every page. Great for keeping track of tasks and scheduling them for later. However, an entire month is missing from the book (Nov) and the pen holder broke right away. I hadn't even used it yet. I wrote to the company asking for the pages to insert. Never got a response. I'm planning to make them up myself because I didn't want to spend the money to send it back to exchange it. All in all, I still think it's the best planner available in some (very few) stores.

UPDATE

I decided to try this planner out after using the Planner Pad system -- which is only available online. I get regular updates from them about replacing last year's pad. One year I used the ""seasons"" version - which I found distracting with all the flowers. Nice looking and great concept, but didn't find it useful for that reason. In years prior, I had successfully used the plain model and should have stuck with that.

Using this Action Day Planner, I found that I still didn't have room for all the notes I wanted to make. It was also missing the entire months of Nov and Dec. I wrote to the company and heard nothing back. Then I decided to just make my own pages for those months. Meanwhile, I was going to return to the Planner Pad system and lo and behold -- they have one with a start month of Oct. So I went ahead and got that one. Glad I did. For me, nothing compares to the Planner Pad system. Action Day Planner is decent - and better than your basic calendar and even organizer -- but it still doesn't beat Planner Pads!",3
"Once finished, these tabs look pretty good. However, applying them was a struggle. They stick to each other, tear easily, and are hard to remove from the backing.",3
Not very easy to remove from the paper that they come on.  The clear sticky tape tore so they were not affixed to the page for very securely.,3
I love the concept and the pages in the planner. I dislike how the pages look like hey are out of old library books and the long hard binding. Seems like it needs to be updated and modernized a bit. Not my go to - I gave it away,3
the print is VERY SMALL,3
"The printer used puts a grey roller line across one side of most of the stickers. Another reviewer mentioned this.

I used tweezers to avoid finger grease, and this worked out well. Only a few of the sticker 'paper' didn't peel away from the waxy/shiny background, so if you just tear at these things, you'll end up ripping the paper label if it's weaker than the glue/adhesive application job at the 'factory'.

Yes, these are ""mini"", but for a super tiny book, or a big one like most of mine, it's fine... I'll upload a few pics witht he labels next to a ruler in a minute.

P.S. I see these ""Used""... Are you kidding me? USED?? Think about it...",3
"THEY ARE NICE BUT TOO THIN AND HAD A HARD TIME APPLYING THEM. I PERSONALY LIKE THE COLORD ONES. THEY WORKED THOUGH.
NOT COMPELELY IMPRESSED",3
"It's OK but wish I had read/seen where it was very small tabs, and for one who is old and/or needs glasses, it is hard to find the right book for the tabs are very, very small!",3
This product does what it is expected to do and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone at all.,3
"I love the layout of Action Day calendars, they are functional and allow for easy access to the top items on your lists or updating a specific list (calls etc.) This calendar works great with anyone using the GTD system. I only wish I could find this layout on better paper. The paper used is thick, scratchy, and absorbent. I find when writing with quicker inks in a fountain pen this paper to promote feathering, it is thick enough that I have not had major issues with bleed when using an extra fine nib. But anything other nib is hard to use, the feathering make it difficult to write within the provided space clearly, and bleed becomes an issue with thicker lines. Then the weight of the paper makes this a fairly thick diary. My final problem is the pen loop; it appears to be only elastic strap glued in, I am already having separation of the back cover and I am a week into 2017. (2 weeks into using this diary).
Action Day makes a great diary/planner lay out but I would recommend the wire bound after a short period of time with this hard-bound version. the available colors are attractive, but a diary that does not lay flat is very difficult to use. Hopefully they will take their great design in the layout of the pages and couple it with a quality binding and paper in the future.
The lay out of the Action Day planner is a clear 5 stars.
the construction of this notebook is 2 stars at best.",3

"The package arrived within a few days of my order. The tooth is about 1 inch in length and the tip is broken off. There is a stick pad inside the specimen box to collect the broken parts. I can glue the tip back on.
This is graded a C- specimen so I am not too surprised. Not bad for the money.",3
Writes smoothly at first  - but if you don't use it everyday it becomes very dried out and  hard to write with.,3
"I received this pen as a gift and I love the body of the pen.  It's sleek, classy, well-built and well-balanced.  The pen writes nicely with high-quality gel ink.  HOWEVER, Cross only offers refills for this pen in one size - medium.  This is terribly frustrating for me since I prefer a very fine point pen.  The line of the pen is simply too broad for my taste and the 3rd party fine-point refills I've tried (Foray and Montverde) are terrible.  Thus, I'm stuck with a pen I really like that I just don't use.

I would not recommend this pen to anyone who prefers writing with a fine point(or smaller).  That said, if you like a medium point pen, this is a good choice.",3
OK,3
"This is a very elegant and balanced pen, and I love its look.  It writes smoothly too -- but for some reason the actual look of what I write is faded and pencil like.  Something is amiss with the way the ink is delivered, and it is not because of the cartridge I used.  I'm not sure I'd have bought this pen if I'd known the quality of the writing it provides.",3
"I like the way it looks and feels, but it doesn't write as well as the Parker Jotter.",3
I got this pen as a gift for my brother. Beautiful..,3
"I wish Cross would make a ""fine point"" for this pen. Love the pen, not a fan of the ""medium"" writing point.",3
"Good pen, not as solid in feel as in the past",3
I keep hearing that Cross pens are not what they use to be and I am very sad to say I found out for myself. I purchased this pen just over a year ago and have only used it slightly and the quality is just not what it once was also the ink already gave out. I have Cross pens that are 20 years old and they are so much better. For the past 30 years or so I have primarily used only Cross pens. I guess I just to need to keep using the older ones.,3
it isjust ok,3
"Both pieces look very nice and have decent ""weight and feel"". However, the pen came with an ink cartridge that leaks a bit. The pencil has a different mechanism as other Cross pencils that I've had in the past. With this one, it is necessary to rotate the cap back and forth to advance the lead in steps. With the ""other"" one, it is only necessary to rotate it on one direction continuously. I prefer the ""other"" mechanism (the original).",3
"I purchased this pen about six months ago (not from Amazon). I collect and restore vintage pens, but I love modern pens as well, and Cross has a very art deco-esque style with some of their pens that I find pleasing.

Pen design is good overall, though you'd be hard-pressed to get the cap to stay tight during a light walk with it in your pocket. The problem is so bad that I'd never carry it in a shirt pocket for fear of the body shimmying out of its cap. The finish is consistent and shiny, if not a smudge magnet. The clip seems strongly attached to the cap, but is not elastic at all. Good luck clipping it into jean pockets.

The pen's section has the same problem that a lot of modern pens can't seem to shake. It's chrome plated, polished, and impossible to get a good grip on. If your hands are dry, they slip. If they're sweaty, they slip. In between? They explode. Or just slip.

The above issues I can get over, but what I couldn't get over was the work that had be done to the nib before it would write. Out of the box it was such a dry writer that it couldn't lay a consistent line. After re-aligning the tines and giving it the baptismal in micro-mesh, it now writes smoothly and with great flow.

I hate to bring it up, but Cross's switch to Chinese manufacturing seems to have really hurt their long-standing reputation of quality. I'll stick with my American-made,14k gold-nib'd Cross Century II.",3
"I have mixed feelings about this.  One part of me is saying that the pen is lighter and more affordable than in the past. Because it got lighter (weight), it fits how I write and the ballpoint is smoother and the ink feels smooth like a gel type ink.
The other part is that the grace and the luxury are gone.  The twist mechanism is loose and does not have the well made / balanced feel of the old, actually it feels very cheap.  Light weight feels cheap and plastic, although it is made of metal.  The balance is way off, too top heavy.  The groves do not line up in either position.
A good pen but there is no grace once was.  Times have changed.  They don't make them like they used to!",3
"Like others, I have discovered the hard way that Cross pens' implementation of a .7 lead cartridge has really reduced the satisfaction with their mechanical pencils. The lead sleeve doesn't fully protrude which leaves an odd looking front end when loaded. Doesn't feel as solid a grip as the earlier .5 pencils. I was happy to hear they have a .7, but not with the quality--very disappointing. I'm sad that Cross quality seems to be diminishing, was always a great American company. I read somewhere that they are manufacturing overseas now, too, not in RI anymore...sorry to hear that, if it is true.",3
Cross pens have been traditionally a high quality USA made pen but the quality has decreased in recent years and not what they use to be.  I am not sure it is worth the cost of these pens for the quality they now have.,3
"Cross pens have an awesome style, feel nice in your hand, good weight, write well, and come in a giftable box. All great. The price is fair - but unlike the old Cross pens made in USA - with very tight fit and finish, this one is made in China, and the pieces don't fit together quite so tightly. It's not what I'd call sloppy, but it's also not the watch-like construction like what you're used to in a premium pen.",3
"Good looking and well made pen/pencil.  Not very comfortable when writing for an extended period.  I have tried both a fine and medium tip ink and both are not smooth when writing, similar to a standard BIC pen. I have found the Parker Jotter as a good lost cost alternative to this pen. Also, look to switch out the ink for another as the best part of this pen is the barrel.",3
Great setup I just wish the quality was a little better.  Pretty flimsy and the magnets aren't as strong as I'd like.,3
"Unfortunately these don't work on android devices.  I have been having problems with the soft tip styluses going bad very quickly so I thought I would try a hard tip.  My fault for not researching this more before I purchased.  Other than that, they feel very sturdy and I imagine would be perfect for the electronic devices they were intended to be used with.",3
Not the same as the original.  Fits too small so had to put tape around it to make it fit.,3
Works ad designed. Received on time.,3
"Can't give it any high rating b/c product wasn't for my own use, but the person that requested it didn't give me any negative feed back so this product met their needs.",3

"I owned a Palm III for a while when it came out, and then stepped up to the V after about a year with my III. What can I say? I was allured by its sexiness and general asthetic appeal.
I have now relied on it for about a  year for all my organizing needs. I have used every part of the Palm  Software suite except the expense reporting feature.
While I like the  Palm V's style, I have become more and more disappointed by its features  and memory issues.
Features: lacks decent sound for starters, a beep is  boring and weak. When I carry the Palm in its home (my pocket) I cannot  hear the alarm tones even with volume maxed! The screen is a mixed bag.  While its clarity is better than other organizers, it is very hard to read  in slightly dim areas because the backlighting leaves a lot to be desired.  Battery power is okay, but not anywhere near the advertised time of 30  days.
Memory is a whole different issue. All I have on my palm is some  1500 addresses and 1000 calendar entries and it tells me I am half full, as  you know they advertise a lot more capacity. I don' use but a couple of  aftermarket programs.
The Graffiti recognizer is crap. When it works it  puts the wrong letters on the screen. Real users need to get Jot! from  CiC.
Palm, Inc.'s tech support is the WORST! Most of their support staff  can hardly speak English; so imagine them trying to explain a highly  technical issue! Whats more, they don't even care. I was pormised a return  call - had to call back. I have not once ever received a real response by  email - only autoresponders that say ""24-48 hours"" - still  waiting on my inquiry from January!
In short, save a little longer and  get the Cassiopeia E-115 (when it comes out). In my experiences with  head-to-head comparrisons of Cassiopeia E-105s to my Palm V, the Cassio was  a true frontrunner! The E-115 will certainly be even better! If you need a  great datebook and address book to keep you straight and don't need sound,  memory, genuine Word Processing, or Spreadsheet, or color screen then GO  WITH THE PALM V!  But if you need features and real performance, get a  Windows CE Device.",3
"A pretty good device overall, but one thing really bugs me.  I have it in a leather case.  I was carrying it in my hand one day and I dropped it.  Only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick, but the rest of the  device was cushioned by the leather.  That incident caused all the screen  touch points to drop.  In order to activiate something, I have to touch  below where it is displayed on the screen.  The functions on the bottom  moved almost completely out of range, and the writing area shifted down  also.  I can't tell if it's because the writing area shifted downwards, but  the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too.  I can't say  anything else bad about it, but what a letdown to know that it can't take  simple impacts.",3
"Heavier paper than what I'm used to, not a big fan for the amount of printing I do. I prefer the HP everyday",3
Quality commensurate with price tag maybe even better.  There are better printer papers and and a lot worse printer papers this one works for me and besides it is a pretty good paper to use with a fountain pen.,3

This product worked acceptably, nothing special.  Upon first use, I experienced large ink dots stuck to the paper which could be scraped off with a fingernail.  The cartridge leaving these ink dots gradually faded away with use; it now only happens occasionally. On most printing, the print is light, but I am not sure if this is not due to the printer as the print quality is no worse with this cartridge than on any of the others that I have used, so I'll reserve judgment for now.",3
Good quality and very sturdy. Great for homeschooling studies. I love the raised areas so the kids can feel the mountain ridges. So far my oldest son has completely taken it apart and put it back together again without any issues.  It did arrive with the equator sticker loose in certain places though which was disappointing. I also feel that it was slightly over priced more than it should have been. Otherwise a great product.,3

"This was a nice calculator for highschool and highschool math competitions.  Back in 1988 when I was an engineering student, this was not the norm.  If you were going to go for an RPN calculator, you did whatever you need to do to get the HP 28C or HP 28S.  I find it ridicuolous to pay more than $50 in 2010 to own this.  May be for a collector, but for a person that is going to be using it, it is just a plain waste of money.  If you are looking to buy one for the EIT or PE, you just go ahead and get the HP 35s for $55 to $70.  The HP 35s has a lot of limitations (on purpouse so NCEE approved it) but at least it has more memory than you can really use.  The 33s did not have enough memory back then or today.  I know there are a lot of HP 32s and 33sii lovers out there, but if you need another go and get the 35s.  HP really did a good job with it.  Even the 1980s RPN (again on purpose due to those damn NCEE Nazis) look and operation.  I may pay more than $150 for a HP 42s or a 41CX than have way more use than the 33sii.  I own a 12C, a 15C, a 28S, 41CV, 33S (another failure), a 42S, 28s, 48SX, 48GX , a 49G (a backward step, more like backward run with hurdles, for HP), 49G+ (better than the 49G, but still behid the workmanship of 48GX), 35s and a 50G (Someone in HP decided to do somthing good after so many years of failures after the 48GX). Notice that I do not own a 32s or sii.",3
"The product works and functions I presume, except I received one with instruction guides both are in spanish. Not one is in English so I am struggling with trying to properly use it because I can't understand the language it's in. Just wondering how can I get the hard copy English guide.",3
"It's bigger than I expected; however, it fits well in one hand.

The hard cover, however, must be completely taken off the back of it and put on the front to protect it. It feels kind of flimsy. It could have been designed better.

It's more comfortable to hold the calculator in your hand without the cover attached to it.",3
it's just a calculator...,3
Quality has gone down since I bought my first T1503SV several years ago (it is still going strong even after daily use).  The display seems off on this one meaning that I can see lines other than the numbers.  It wasn't worth the time to send it back since I purchased it as an add-on item.,3
"I sent it back unopened after reading reviews indicating that reliability has gone down dramatically since HP switched manufacturers. Went on eBay to buy a ""vintage"" unit instead!",3
Ok calculator,3
"Returned product, didn't need it after all",3
"This is a great calculator which one MAJOR flaw in my opinion. The 6 operator keys on the bottom right row are silver. The silver is very difficult to determine which key is which unless you look directly at the keys (perpendicular to the calculator). If you lay it on a table and try to use it, you often cannot see which keys are which. This isn't an issue with any other model TI. Grey keys would have had much higher contrast.

Also, the LCD characters are NOT BLACK like the promotional pictures display. They are blue. The blue characters provide an inferior contrast compared with black characters. Disappointing.

TI, please update the design! A great calculator which a huge miss in my opinion.",3
Bought the calculator just a few months ago. Easy to operate. There were discrepancies in values sometimes. Today it totally quit working. Only zero can be punched and none of  the other buttons work. Either the calculator shipped to me was defective of this series itself is worse.,3
3/4 into the school year the display started to go out.  Was required to get this model so there was not much choice about what to get.,3
"A classic! Please be aware of the RPN (Reverse Polish Notation). The batteries must be changed, since the calculator does not have the solar panel, a bummer.",3
"Its ok, work well, no problems.",3
Disappointed only because it has no solar option. It arrived quickly and as described.,3
I don't care for the curving of the machine,3
I bought the Texas Instruments name. Design is Cute but offers no benefit in use.,3
"It's a calculator. It works. It doesn't have a lot of the newer functions (poly-solver, mathline display, more than a single liine), but it was required for one of my classes to make sure we didn't cheat. It's cheap, and pretty decent for the money. Just don't expect it to do much.",3
"I've used this calculator many times before and it's a good basic calculator.  The display was dim straight of of the package, which I think was a battery issue.",3
Has good operability for a small calculator.,3
Disappointed in quality.  Have to press really hard to make sure numbers are entered.,3
"This is your classic HP business financial calculator -- about equivalent to the HP 38C that came before it.  In the past HP used to provide a quick start guide, user use & programming manual, some little pocket quick-reference foldout cards, and even would mail you a special programming guide.  Now you only get the quick start guide and a CD.  The quick start guide is fairly USELESS for a calculator with so many quirks and features. The CD is no replacement for a physical owners manual because (1) the computer-printout manual is very bulky and (2) it lacks color.  So you have to go onto ebay and buy an 12c manual -- which adds another $15 or $20 to the cost of the calcualtor. Also, the case feels cheap, but there's nothing new about that.  A leather case will cost another $20. All that being said, it's a WONDERFUL calculator.  Just plan on buying a manual and possibly as case.  Bad job, HP!!!",3
"Ordered three, two worked.
No problem with refund.",3
"The battery was going dead, I thought. So I bought new batteries and replaced them and it still looked like it was dying. I asked a student to play with it (they have more time than I do - I am a math teacher) to see if he could figure out what was wrong and he said a panel was bent inside. I am sure it was  a fluke - the calculator was delivered fast and it looked good. I can probably still use it, but you have to tilt the screen to see the characters. They fade in and out. This particular calculator wears like iron, I know, from years of buying calculators for the classroom. This is the first one that was not great.",3
its ok,3
Item(s) arrived safe and on time. I'm satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to a friend.,3
"Good price, but the placement of some of the keys are odd. It makes little sense for Texas Instrument to make a nice calculator like this have whatever this arrow sign is where every other calculator they made had a plus sign. There are people like me who try to use the calculator where the simple numbers and the multiplying, division, adding, and subtracting buttons are in the same place as every other calculator. In the first week of having this I have gotten the error just about every other time I use it because I am use to their TI-83, TI-84, and TI-30 button locations.

You don't change up the most common aspect of a calculator. It would be like iPhone changing the home button to the right instead of in the middle. You may get use to it over time but it is irritating to adapt to something you did differently for 10yrs.

Besides that it is good, but it is is hard to enjoy it now that I am no longer taking Calculus. Bought it simply because I lost by 10yr old TI-30, that was perfect for the job, while on vacation.",3
Sometimes button clicks don't register. I hate the feel of the buttons too. Functions fine.,3
worked ok,3
works,3
I am disappointed in this calculator.  It's not what I wanted at all!,3
It works for what i need it for.,3
"If I had to choose between the TI-83 and TI-84, I would buy the TI-84 and save the money purchasing this calculator cost me.  This is an older model calculator, good, but has some limitations.  Functions require extra steps, such as remember to use ( ) in places that you wouldn't have to think about them with the TI-84.  The space on this calculator is too small to accommodate updates. That being said, it is less expensive, and works just fine for remedial math up through College Math 80 (Intermediate Algebra).

Sadly this calculator doesn't have the space to add the needed upgrades, in order for it to function as it needs to for more advanced classes.  As my Math 114 Professor said... Most classes are being taught using the TI-84, so just buy that one!  She was right and I did, now my 11 year old math wiz of a niece is getting this old calculator to start learning on.

So if you will be taking more than a college math 80 class and don't want to drive yourself nuts by remembering to add things and do odd ball things to functions, save yourself the added expense and buy the TI-84.",3
"This stylus's tip seems to be of a harder plastic than that of the Palm III's (the one with a silver metal body and grey plastic ends). Having just switched from III to V, the difference was dramatic.  I have spares of the  III type at my desk -- it's quicker to just grab that than pull the Palm's  one out, and I won't forget to put it back.
I'm afraid of wearing down  my Palm's sensor surface, so am shopping for a ""softer"" stylus  for the V.  (The V's are a touch slimmer, so my spare stylii won't fit its  holder.)",3

"This thing is ugly and the buttons are kinda sticky so you have to watch out.  Good for kids, not for adults.",3
"Unresponsive buttons, I have to press a few time for it to register on the screen especially when I'm typing fast. That's a bummer, because I'm very sure my other similar price calculator such as the Casio FX-115ES has a much better responsive keys, allowing me to type as fast as I want (albeit a little bit higher price than this one).
The rest of this calculator's features work fine, perfect for using it in math class. Be warn though, the slow-response button might slow you down in your test time.",3
"Comparing this to the 'identical' product I've had for over a year, I am disappointed to find Avery has made this card noticeably thinner.  It went from being a nice sturdy card to just okay.  Guess that is their way of reducing their costs by using less trees in the manufacturing process.",3

I recall owning one of these a few years back and having the buttons work much better. but maybe thats just my memory giving it a warm fuzzy glow.

I probably wouldn't repurchase this exact model, but it does what it is supposed to.",3
"These are the same very-high quality greeting cards that I have always used.  But, for some reason, Avery changed its envelopes.  They are now downgraded to thinner stock and (somehow) the glue has stuck the envelopes shut!  There is no fix for this, as far as I can tell. Since many greeting cards are mailed or stuffed in an envelope and affixed to a present, this is a big problem - the envelopes are part of the deal, right?  If I can find another good brand, I'm going to switch. Shame on you Avery - you are throwing your great reputation away.",3
"These are OK for casual use, but they're thin to the point where you'd never mistake this for a ""greeting card"" weight item. More like a piece of slightly heavier paper than copy or inkjet paper.

They're useful, but leave a lot to be desired.",3
Sticky buttons that you really have to press down in order for them to read which is irritating. I should have gotten a larger and more durable scientific calculator.,3
Worked great yet hard learning curve to use it,3
"You get what you pay for I guess. This calculator is not hard to use it's just that there are no proper instructions that tell's you what some of the extra functions are for and what they do. what sucks is that you can't get a derivative in un-simplified form, meaning you have to provide an x value. I took my calculus 1 exam and I did not need this calculator because it  can't graph or do advanced things I think this calculator would be perfect for my little sister who is in the 4th grade currently computing fractions...",3
"The card paper is very nice and heavy. The envelopes are thin and the card shows through. That's kind of tacky.
Pros: The card stock is nice and heavy.
It prints very well with my Canon Pixma with generic ink
The card is scored so you get a perfect fold

Cons: The envelopes are thin enough that you can see the card through them.",3
"Cards are as described, but the score is not perfectly centered. When you fold each card, they're off by about 1/8"", making the edge misaligned ever so slightly. It's fine for homemade cards but it would be nice if it were designed just a tad bit more precisely.",3
"I have used these greeting cards for years and have been very satisfied. But, I noticed the pound weight has been decreasing. They are slightly too light to make a nice presentation.. Wish we could have the old card stock back.  It had more of a quality feel.",3
"This heavyweight, scored paper is well priced.  The half fold works fine.  However, the quarter fold leaves uneven edge alignment that I have to razor off.",3
came with no return policy and no manual - wasted the money on this not for an amature like me.,3
"The calculator works fine, but I wasn't expecting there to be names carved into the cover. It also didn't come with batteries. The product itself is fine though!",3
"Nice quality. The printed pictures had a bit of overlap, though. Overall satisfied.",3
great,3
"This calculator is okay. I'd recommend the TI-30X over this one. This one can do a little more, so if that's important to you then get this one. Otherwise, get the TI-30X since it has a 2 line display.",3
"Used it once then resold it.  It was very useful for my class. Too bad it didn't come with instructions; therefore, 3 stars.",3
Make sure your ordering the right product that is for you or your child there are so many functions that you can do with this graphing calculator that you may just need something more simplier. Other than that good product.,3
"My calculus teacher did not allow graphing or calculators that could display more than two lines, so I ordered this one.

 I don't know if it's just the one I got or they're all like that, but the buttons on mine were a bit difficult to press. I had to press very deliberately in order for the numbers to input on the screen. If I was trying to type the numbers in very fast and I didn't press the numbers hard enough, it would skip numbers.  I've had calculators that only required light touch, so this was a negative for me.  I kept it just because returning was a hassle  and I needed it for my class :/",3
"Great features, but rather slow to calculate trigonometric functions.",3
It okay because its too cheaply made.  The original blue/black is of much better quality than this color calculator.,3
"It's kinda my fault for expecting more similarity in function to a Ti89.  So no way to cheat the system here.  You cannot enter in indefinite integrals or change parameters to include variables such as 8a etc... and get a undefined solution. Though it has the a,b,c,b,d button they seem rather pointless.  Any way, this review is was done before I previewed the tutorial, maybe that will help.",3
"I've used a TI-83+ for over 10 years now for all my engineering calculations. I love it and it would be very difficult to change.

I purchased this model because it was one of the approved models for the Fundamentals of Engineering exam.
It's pretty sleek and has more functions than you could possibly need. It got me through the exam.

I had some difficulty getting used to it because the /, X, -, + buttons are shifted up a row from most other calculators. This model as a +/- operation button on the right hand column. Often I would use the wrong operator just from muscle memory of my other calculator.

If you are looking for a non-graphing calculator, there are other brands (HP) that have a better button layout which make quicker and easier use.
For example, the HP has a dedicated button for ANS, where this one has it as a 2nd function. If working problems where you often refer to the previous answer, it might save you some time to look at a different model.",3
"Okay so, it did what is was supposed to do. It was the measurements as described and my kids use it on an easel. Nuff said.",3
Decent calculator though I honestly don't know much about the scientific functions nor how to use them (it comes with a decent manual and quick reference card). Just hope you get the color you kid wants (and you paid extra for) from the seller as I didnt!,3
"These calculators are so confusing to me and the directions didn't offer much assistance to me. I essentially bought it because it was pink, but I wish I would have gone with a different one. If you know how to use these then it should do the job, but it was really confusing for me.",3
Too much error code...does not work for me and gives a lot of problems.  I will used it when I have no other choice.  Texas Instruments are always good.  Not sure why I am not having a good experience with this one.,3
"Had one of these a long time ago in middle school, now I'm a college senior.  I stopped using it when the LCD decided to call it quits for no reason (an 8 would look like a 3).  The buttons are super mushy and the calculator only lets numbers be entered *very* slowly.  So slow, in fact, you have to waste time checking the screen to make sure it didn't miss a button press.  The lid is more snap-on than slide on, so it wears out really fast.

Replaced it with a Casio FX-300MS that I still have/use to this day...8 years later.  It has more functions, less wasted space (just look at the huge bezel around the screen on the TI), short stroke fast button response, and faster computation speed.  However, if you are looking for a graphing calculator, no competition hands down the TI-89 Titanium wins (I mainly use that calculator nowadays).

In summary, there is no reason to buy this calculator over a Casio.",3
"Perhaps the only bummer with the Palm V series is that they have a slow serial port connection, which takes much longer to Sync than a USB port. I'd recommend buying the USB PalmConnect kit instead, which costs about the same. Shop around.",3
"This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.  I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200, both of which I love.  I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.  I didn't have a lot of money to spend, so this one seemed to fit the bill.  I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones, though.  It has all the functions I want, including storing the previous answer, but the buttons don't always register a key press.  It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental.  It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register.  It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press, either.  The button presses just don't get picked up some times.",3
"If you are thinking of using this calculator for Algebra, Geometry, basically any straight math, especially Calculus, DON'T.  That is not to say it won't work, just that there are better things out there, namely the TI-89.  The 89 is somewhat more expensive, but, in my opinion and experience, it is far superior for these applications.  A few reasons:  easier to get the results from previous entries, support for derivitives and integrals, and the higher resolution looks better and lets you put more on the screen at one time, as well as allowing more symbols.  However, if you are planning on using the calculator for Statistics, get the 83, because, for some unknown reason, the TI engineers declined to put ANY suppport for stats on the 89, but the 83 is great at it.  I have owned TI calculators for many years, and I have never experienced any quality or production problems with them and have never had any of them break except when treated REALLY badly, such as having very heavy, blunt objects dropped on the screen, and I do tend to use mine pretty hard.",3
"Good enough I suppose, but not very much wrist support.",3
"The mouse pad is generally comfortable to use but the blue color gets stained so so easily. I only used it at home office and very noticeable dark sweat stains are seen, especially near the palm rest pad.",3
"I bought it and am just keeping it, unopened, just in case. When a mousepad emergency pops up. BOOOOYAH!",3
it is what it is,3
"This mouse pad is really hard. After use for awhile, my wrist hurts a lot and so I switch to resting the palm of my hand and before long it hurts too. I find I am no fan of a gel mouse pads. Wish I had chosen another type.since I am at my computer for hours at a time. Frankly, I can't in all honesty recommend this pad to anyone.",3
"Got this on 10/27.  I was excited, tore open the package and started to use it.  It didn't take long for my wrist to start hurting.  OK I'm use to using a flat mouse pad.  The wrist gel hump is new for me, so taking that into consideration, I will give it 3 stars for now.  Come back in a few months for an update.

UPDATE:  If you usually use a flat mouse pad, then I would leave this alone.  However, if you want to give it a try, give yourself some time to get a feel for it.  It is an adjustment.",3
"good price, it does the job, but nothing to write home about however I would probably buy again for a 2nd computer if price was right",3
Its an okay product nothing great to talk about. If you want to get a cheap one you can go for it.,3
"I have a very old gel mouse pad and the wrist rest is soft and squishy.  I needed another but there was no identification on my old pad so I had to start my search from scratch.

Based upon the ratings, I bought this Belkin WaveRest pad and was startled at the firmness, especially on the inside edge.  However, I decided to keep it and use it until I found something better.

Now that I have been using it for almost three weeks, I find that it does work to hold my wrist in the correct position.  Either it has softened a bit in the past few weeks or I have grown use to it. However, I probably would not purchase this style again.",3
Comfortable mouse pad,3
"Doesn't feel like it has gel at all, more like stiff foam.  I have a 10 year old jell rest that is, well, jell-like.  This is not it.",3
the gel got hard and it was not comfortable for very long... already replaced it.,3
I needed a mouse pad and purchased this one. I was used to a high wrist rest and a more gel like consistency. It is ok and I will continue to use it but I wish I had my old one back.,3
"I wanted a mouse pad, wrist rest for my desk.  I saw this and it seemed like it would fit the bill.
While the pad/rest is better than not having one, the gel in the wrist rest is too firm.  This makes it uncomfortable for long term use.",3
"I mean, it's not gel. I still use it tho.",3
"it is sunk in, in the middle almost like they didn't provide enough fill?",3
Good Product Fast Delivery,3
good,3
Wrist guard gives out too soon,3
"It's thinner and flimsier than I thought it would be, but it works.",3
NOT GOOD FOR BIG HANDS OR any type of graphic or gaming. Good for browsing or little mouse work..,3
It's smaller then I thought. The wrist is small too. But it works.,3
This toner cartridge was exactly as presented in the ad.  No problem with this transaction at all.  Will pay from this vendor in the future.,3
"Just fine, not sure what I can say more than that",3
"Aging machines have produced a supply and demand heart ache. The product works very wellperiod. Sadly, Canon like other manufacturers loves redesigning toner for each machine so you must upgrade your product to be able to afford to print, such as my case.

I have ordered third market toners before and have been pleased, but to be honest productivity isn't always the best and I have some ladies in my office who want nothing less than excellent performance.

I am giving the product three star not based on performance, but on value.",3
no comment,3
"After being disappointed by generic toners, bought the brand name to go with my copier.  Honestly, I haven't noticed a big difference in the quality, and I am having to shake the toner after only a hundred or so copies (just like the generic).  Not sure the extra money for the brand name cartridge is worth it.",3
"The pad is about the right elevation for large hands and it feels comfortable when moving the mouse around. However, the material that covers it all started tearing loose during the first week of use. I'm going to keep using it until it's done for, but I will go back to a regular pad when I reorder.",3
Mouse pad area could be a little bigger & the gel wrist rest is not very soft but it works.,3
"Too small of an area. Very limited space to move the mouse around. Don't feel like sending it back, but will probably give it away.",3
"So so mouse pad, the cushion is too stiff, not a soft gel pad like I hoped.  I turn it sideways and don't use the pad.",3
Nice but a little large,3
The wrist bump is almost too high and is uncomfortable. I moved it around and now just use the flat part.,3
Item as described but not soft and make noises as hand are rested on it. Good service thanks!,3
The gel part is flatter than I would have hoped.,3
its alright.....but doesn't support my wrist as well as I had hoped,3
"This is my second purchase of this mouse pad. My first one lasted over 10 years. Much better than a flat mouse pad which does nothing to protect you from problems like carpal tunnel. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and is very comfortable. I have never had any wrist problems and my business keeps me on the computer with mouse in hand 8-10 hours a day. If I had one suggestion it would be to keep your fingernails filed well. The material has a tendency to snag slightly on rough nails or skin. It's still held up well but it can be annoying at times.

(2 year UPDATE)  This only lasted a year before the cover started falling off. These are not glued like the earlier one. Put up with the floppy material as it came unglued but now I have to replace with something with better quality.",3
"I think these are only okay. I prefer a harder surface that is less porous and easier to clean. Only lasted a year so.
Another thing is that this surface seems like an eyelash or something would get stuck on it, and then cause my optical mouse to freak out. The harder models do not have that issue.

I recommend this model:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Innovera-Gel-Mouse-Pad-with-Wrist-Rest-Nonskid-Base-8-1-4-x-9-5-8-Inches-Black-51450/dp/B00134D3BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Innovera Gel Mouse Pad with Wrist Rest, Nonskid Base, 8-1/4 x 9-5/8 Inches, Black (51450)</a>. Seems to last longer.",3
"a fair mousepad for a fair price.

My 6th attempt at posting a review. At this point, I don't think anything I post will be accepted.",3
I bought this to replace the same style mousepad of a different brand. This Belkin's wrist pad is noticeably smaller than my previous one. I would've preferred more height to the pad.,3
"ok, smelled like ""burnt plastic"" for weeks.",3
"This gel mouse pad works but really annoys me!
The center of the wrist pad if filled with some sort of noisy material.  When I lift my wrist up off of the pad it makes a ""crinkley"" sound, kind of like a loud plastic bad being crunched up.
Other than that, the mouse pad is perfect.  But, a noisy mouse pad is not something I want, must be why it was so cheap.",3
"I have an older version of this, and the gel is much softer (less firm).

I find the new gel to be uncomfortably firm, and it doesn't allow my wrist to ""settle"" into it like the older version.",3
"After using this now for about a month, there is an indent where my wrist sits, and it's a little uncomfortable. I thought it would spring back for a longer period of time.",3
Decent,3
Nice mouse pad for the price. But after a couple of weeks the foam pad lost it's shape and became flat.,3
It was just ok.,3
Mouse doesn't always track we'll on it,3
A bit softer for the wrist than I would have liked but it does the job.,3
"This mouse pad is functionally okay (how hard is it to screw up a mouse pad, after all?) but Belkin clearly cut some corners in production and wasn't thinking of the consumer experience. It arrives in the dreaded clamshell packaging, and when you first open it, the chemical smell is overwhelming. After using it for just a few minutes, my wrist now smells like plasticizer, and the smell lingers for hours. How hard is it really to make something that's easy to open and doesn't smell like chemicals?",3
Jell is rather hard & hurts the wrist more than helps it.,3
Comfortable to rest my wrist on and adequate room to move the mouse.,3
The mouse didn't roar.,3
"Wife already had been using of these WaveRest mouse pads for work and wanted another since she liked it so much.  Now she's got one for each workstation and a happy wife makes a happy life.  I've personally used the keyboard version of this item for years and in fact still do.

Only concerns are the relatively small mouse pad area and durability, but for the cost, it's good value for what you get.",3
Just average....it starts to wear down and gets tears along the edges within a few months.  I don't think I would recommend this item..I expected more from it.,3
Good mouse pads,3
"The surface on this is too smooth, and I am having trouble getting the mouse to work accurately, which for a painting program is important. It may get better as it gets dirtier, but I would have liked to have it work great out of the box. I do like the rest pad for the wrist, it's comfortable.",3
"Comfortable, but came apart after a while.",3
"Nice fabric. The wrist support is not very flexible like I expected 'gel' to be. Uncomfortable for my wrist. I use the mouse pad area, though.",3
"It's ok... not the best. It kind of sinks down in the center of the cushion and doesn't rise back up, almost like a defect or something. It works, but I wouldn't buy it again if given the choice.",3
"I either returned it or threw it away. When it arrived there was a giant air bubble in the middle of the mousepad that made it not-flat. I'm hoping it was just a dud, which is why I gave it a 3/5.",3
I liked this mouse pad until the cover started to come off of the wrist rest.  It got a lot of use but it was less than a year old when the cover started to come off.,3
It is really light weight and feels kind of cheap.  The screen is kind of hard to read.,3
"I was surprised that I was not pleased with this product.  It arrived well packed, however upon opening you encounter this strong odor from the pad, not pleasant at all.  I left them to ""air out"" for a few days before presenting to various users in our office.  It appears that smell does go away in time.  The pad themselves however have a slight wave/ wrinkle that again might go away with use.  I personally will not replace my separate pad / wrist rest combo with this product.",3
"Some of the fabric is bubbling by the pad, which worries me that it may disconnect from the rubber on the bottom.",3
It was not as thick as I thought it would be.,3
"The cushion is good and mine doesn't have an odor as some reviewers noted. But I was disappointed to find the surface was for a track ball mouse, not the laser. Used it for a short time then discontinued.",3
"I used this shredder at home for about 5 years, and it served me well until it broke. While shopping for a new shredder, I checked the reviews written on my old one, and was surprised how accurately the minor and major problems that I had are desribed in the existing reviews.

It may be a repetition of what has already been written, but: the main advantage of this unit which I think is the only reason to consider its purchase is that it cuts paper in quite small pieces (5/32 by 4/5 inches), smaller than the majority of other shredders in the same price range. You much more often find shredders which cut into almost twice as large 5/32 by 1 3/8"" size. Clearly, the smaller the pieces, the safer is the document destruction.

The disadvantages, which one can live with but which are still annoying, is that (a) it tends to jam if you are not careful to make sure that you do not feed in more than 10 pages; unopened junk mail envelopes do not always go through. You can usually clear the jam by reversing the direction, but sometimes this does not work either. Than a screwdriver and tweezers come to the rescure... (b) if you need to shred a large amount of paper (a stack thicker than an inch), it is likely that the shredder will overheat, shut down automatically, and you will have to wait for half an hour to resume the process. The latter, however, is not a surprise cause this shredder is not intended for continous use, and it is indicated in its manual that it needs to cooldown after every 10-15 min of non-stop work. Finally, paper must be held in a very accurate straight and vertical position before feeding it into the shredder, otherwise it will fold and possibly jam.

The major problem which I encountered recently and which ultimately ended this shredder's useful life is remarkably similar to the one described by someone else: two of the plastic guide teeth which separate paper from the cutters broke, which led to almost permanent and unavoidable paper jams and to a serious damage of the plastic housing by paper debries pushed inside by the cutters. (One has to disassemble the shredder to see this housing and the plastic teeth). The only way to keep the shredder running is to manually clean the paper from between the cutters from the grooves where the plastic teeth are missing. Since this has to be done every 20 or so pages, it is not an option. In theory, this problem could be easily fixed by replacing the part with guide teeth, a piece of plastic which cannot possibly cost more than $5, or better yet, the whole plastic housing (four little internal parts). Alas, Fellowes does not provide any repair services for home and office shredders through its authorized repair centers (such luxury as repair is only offered for commercial large shredders which do not fit under a desk), and does not sell any spare parts. They actually state on their web site that their home and office products are not repairable. So, once a little plastic teeth broke, your $200 piece of office machinery goes to trash - no other options offered.

Even though this shredder served me well over the last 5 years and cut into pieces thousands of pages, I will not be buying another Fellowes shredder. Well deserved 3-star rating.",3
"I bought this exact shredder a few years ago.  It makes the smallest pieces of all the shredders out there back then and today.  Unfortunately it is not the most heavy duty shredder and unfortunately one of the metal pieces broke.  I called up Fellowes warranty department and was denied.  I called to speak to someone else and was denied.  They want me to send back the shredder which would cost me a lot and they may or may not replace.  They told me that most of the time, they find it ""Is not under warranty.""  I am thinking about getting the one at Costco, even though the one at Costco does not cut as small.",3
"Decent quality, I suppose --, but the shape of the 'wave' rest (which is hard to see in the picture, but it hollows out in the middle - like a 'wave' -- then only supports fully on both ends) was so uncomfortable on my carpal tunnel (where I had surgery several years ago) that I'm giving it away after just a few days. (I would have returned it -- but the hard plastic casing was so tough to open that I had to pretty much destroy the packaging to get the product out.)

Perhaps those who don't yet have carpal tunnel syndrome might find it OK... but I just replaced it with a standard (one height) memory foam wrist rest mouse pad by HandSprings -- which for me is far more comfortable than this Belkin WaveRest gel mouse pad.  Disappointing purchase... but the shipment came on time -- so the seller was fine.",3
Purchased this for my college class and thank goodness the teacher gave instructions on how to use it or else I would have been lost.  I haven't used it since.  In my opinion this is not good for basic addition and subtraction but great for complex math problems that you need equations to solve.,3
Definitely does its job as a financial calculator. Might be me but I usually have to hit the buttons twice or not as quickly so they register appropriately on the calculator.,3
It works but sometimes the buttons doesn't read your pushes. You need to make sure you push firmly down on the buttons.,3
Good calculator for calculating annuities and bonds but otherwise I would recommend another. The lack of memory function makes it inefficient.,3
It's really a bit too large and keep falling off the table. IT is well cushioned and is holding up so far.,3
Its okay but the bump isn't gel like I thought and the pad part seems cheap. I would look for other options if you're reading this review. For the price though I cant complain too much.,3
This feels like a really cheaply made calculator.. I hope it does not break on me while using it for school. If I barely touch the screen or use the bottoms at the top it leaves black lines from the display.,3
"This mouse pad is somewhat smaller that regular one.  The wrist raise is very low which does not help much supporting the wrist.  Still find it painful to use my mouse with this pad.

The support is not stiff but sink as you rest on it.  But for the price, I can coupe with it.  This will be the last one from Belkin.  I'll find other brand next time when this wear out.",3
"the mouse wrist support is adequate but, and this is a big but, they need to be wider to allow left to right sweeping motions without having to pickup the mouse and do it one or two more times.",3
"When I saw the word ""gel"" I thought ""soft."" I was wrong on that one. The armrest is very firm. I have Carpal Tunnel and this mouse pad does provide support, but can be very uncomfortable after long periods of use. Also, I have a Wireless Logitech Laser mouse that doesn't move as smoothly as it should on the material of this WaveRest mouse pad. Not a bad item, it's just not for me.",3
"I already have one, but I got this for under my leaning-elbow. That's right, I tend to lean on my elbow on my non-mouse hand it it was causing pain. It's elbow worthy, but the bump on the end is not as plump as the one I use for my mouse.

It might work well if you have a tight space between the underside of a desk and the mouse tray on some desks though, so don't dismiss it either. I'm a gamer and a writer, so I am at my PC for hours and hours. I need that extra padding. This should work for most people though.",3
"If you have a completely flat surface, and do not need precision tracking, this mousepad is great.  My surface was not completely level, and the mouse pad bent.  Also, it did not track nearly as accurately as my old 3M mousepad, which wore out.  I bought the latest 3M version, and will try that instead.",3
I got this for work and it work fine.. similar product like this at office depot is like 25 bucks,3
Not one of the better looking models but it gets the job done.  Battery life has been solid so far.,3
The decimal point is so tiny. I also wish this was a two-line calculator,3
This mouse pad is very comfortable but with my old mouse with a brighter LED the shinny surface the arrow went nuts and was all over the screen. The newer mouse worked fine. For the older mouse I put my older mouse pad on the new one.,3
"This product has worked perfect for what we needed to use it for. We will order it again if needed :-)

Thank you very much",3
"Not the best one that I have purchased.  The wrist rest is not solid gel.  Has some spots where the gel is not as thick as others.
Have to move wrist around to where it is more comfortable.  Would probably not buy again.",3
"These take a while to beak in and conform to your hand. I've had a couple like them in the past. My only gripe is the smell. Most mouse pads seem to smell this way for a week or two, it's just the new-mouse-pad smell I guess.

I've had this since March 13th. It's Sept. 16th and the thing is about shot a creese has developed accrost the wrist support, so it's not a very high quality mouse pad. I'll be shopping for another brand.",3
"May be good for advanced users.  For my job as an investment adviser, I had to push a bunch of buttons to do simple calculations",3
I did not like the feel of the pad because it is uncomfortable period and does no good for your wrist.,3
"Great functionality in the calculator, however the keys feel so cheap. Sometimes it feels like I press down the keys and it didn't actually go through and I have to start the transaction from scratch.",3
I prefer the HP12C but for a workhorse calculator for the CFA examination you can't really go wrong with this model and its great price. Skip the Casio and get this one.,3
I have not had a chance to really learn the complex functions. The buttons are a nice size and not sensitive. I am planning to use it for the CFA preparation and exam. I am overall very pleased with it.,3
"I was hoping this would solve my wrist issues, but unfortunately, it's just not what I expected. First, it smells like paint thinner or cheap plastic. I even aired it outside all day and that didn't help. I'm getting a headache from it. I'll give it a couple days before I decide to return it. Second, the padded wrist area is not as soft or ""gel-like"" as I had hoped. It's still better than laying my wrist across the edge of my desk, but all-in-all it is somewhat disappointing.",3
"i was forced to use this for a while, and at first the wristpad is very hard, but it eventually molds to your wrist. so if you give it time, this mousepad gets comfortable.",3
"I have carpel tunnel and I using a mouse pad with a wrist guard really helps.  I noticed that at home my wrist was starting to act up again so I thought I would try a new mouse and mouse pad.  I have had the mouse pad for two weeks. When I first got it I was exicted it was very soft and comfortable and felt like the memory foam on my bed.  Than after a week or so the middle of the wrist guard started to bow in the middle.  Now when I move my wrist it soundls like crinkiling paper being rubbed together.

I have a Fellowes Microban at my office computer and I really like it.  It includes a u shape cradle for your wrist built in.  All in all the Belkin is the worst mouse wrist guard i have tried (i also use the one by 3m on another computer that i use frequently).",3
"I purchased the BA II Plus Financial calculator on the recommendation of my Finance professor. Certainly the calculator is specially geared toward financial calculations (Time Value of Money, Interest, etc.) and will save some students a great deal of time. But my gripe with the BA II Plus is in its complexity. It is almost impossible for a novice to pick up the most beneficial uses of the calculator without sifting through a thick manual. It is not user friendly in the least, nor is it a good calculator for non-Finance courses. In statistics, for example, one would run into a great deal of trouble with the automatic rounding function of the BA II Plus. This can be turned off, but I could not do it without the assistance of someone from Texas Instruments. Add to that, I am still unable to use mathematical parenthesis on the BA II plus, or fractions, so often I must revert back to another scientific calculator in order to more easily perform those functions.

Within its narrow range of finance problems, the calculator does an fair job. But outside the subject, students will end up needing a more versatile machine than the BA II plus.",3
"The TI BA Plus II is a better calculator than most of the current TI models.
Pros:
It's a nice conservative brown color and not a day glo blue or some other candy color.
The button feel (button feel a critical factor in buying a calculator) is much better than most TIs but it still could be improved.  (It is not as good as the HP 12c).  One shouldn't have to keep looking at the display to see if the number was keyed correctly.
The different colored keys make it easy to find the various functions.
The display is uncluttered and easy to read.
The alpha characters on the left side of the display make it easy to know what data you are entering and what the resulting number from a calculation refers to.
It has a backspace key.
The manual is well written and very complete.
Cons:
The number of key strokes that you need to do the simplest things is unbelievable.  For example, to change the decimal format you have to press 2nd, format, [the number referring to the number of places], enter, 2nd, quit.  Compare this to the HP 12c where you just press F and the number referring to the number of places.  Six steps on the TI verses 2 on the HP.
The calculator has no weight to it.  It seems flimsy.  I would be very afraid of dropping it.  The HP 12c is a tank by comparison.
The hard plastic slip ""case"" doesn't fit securely.
There is no way to change the contrast of the display.
Extra steps are required to do TVM calculations as compared to the HP 12c since with the TI you have to press the CPT key to get an answer.  If you forget to do that then the display number becomes a new, unintended variable.
It doesn't retain the display when you shut the calculator off.
The arrow on the backspace key points the wrong way.  Compare it to the backspace key on your computer.
It's easier to change the battery in your watch than it is in this calculator.
The ""cheat sheet"" in the plastic cover is only paper and very easy to loose.  The HP has it printed on the back of the calculator.
No rubber feet!  How much can these cost?  That means you have to use two hands with this calculator; one to hold it so it doesn't slide around the table and one to enter data.  You can't enter data with one hand and keep track of your place on a list of numbers with the other.
Not noticeably faster than the HP 12c which was designed over 20 years ago.
Conclusion:  This calculator is better than most on the TIs in this price range mostly because of the improved button feel and the quality of the display but it would do well to take some lessons from the 80's and incorporate some of the features of the HP 12c.  It's the little things that make a good calculator a great calculator.  A calculator should be like an extension of you and not something that you have to constantly think about in addition to the business/math problems that you are working on.  My first choice for a business calculator is the HP 12c but, if you are short on money, this is a good second choice.",3

"*** 2015-02-09 Update ***
Works Great After Adjustment

I got curious one day and decided to see what exactly was causing staples to jam in the new T50 I purchased. I disassembled the bottom of the stapler and checked to see if everything fit correctly. All the parts and their placement seemed to be in order. I then decided to slide some staples down the rail used to hold and align the staples. Using a full 'clip' of staples everything seemed to work fine -- I was able to slide the clip back and forth without issue.

I then separated 10 individual staples from the clip and placed them onto the rail. I used the spring-loaded staple pusher to slowly and carefully push the individual staples down the rail as a group. When the group got near the driving end (stapling end) of the rail I noticed a problem. The first couple of staples slid just fine, but the next one hung up and caused a jam. I repeated this test several times reordering the individual staples. Sometimes the first staple would jam, while other times most of the staples would slide through before a jam occurred.

At first I thought it might be a problem with the staples, but they all seemed to be identical, unbent, and undamaged. Upon closer inspection I noticed that the gap between one side of the rail and the center of the rail was narrower than the other side -- this is where the staples were hanging. I used a flat-headed screwdriver to bend out the side of the rail until all the individual staples would slide without hanging. I then reassembled the gun and it worked without jamming.

I loaned the gun to a person who is recovering a living room couch. I warned this person about the jamming issue I had and told her to let me know if she has any problem. The couch is now almost completed and the gun didn't jam a single time. We estimate hundreds of staples have now been run through the gun without issue.

Consequently, I've adjusted my rating on the T-50 from 1 star to three stars. I still think there is a quality control issue with this stapler (hence all the negative reviews) that customers shouldn't have to remedy themselves. Once I resolved the misaligned rail problem, however, the stapler works better than the old T50 I replaced. If you feel up to it, you may want to try to repair your stapler the same way I did.

*** 2014-11-16 Review ***
Another Victim Of Corporate Shortsightedness

I inherited a T-50 from my father that he bought back in the late 1960s or early 1970s. That stapler went through hell and back and always performed great until the last few months. Cleaning and lubricating it has no effect -- it's simply worn out. Thinking what I great stapler it was I purchased a new T-50, but what a disappointment. The new unit jammed after only 5 staples. I had to take it apart to free the jam. I inserted another rail of Arrow staples and it jammed up again after about 10 staples. The nickel plating covering this thing is also flaking off.

Most likely Arrow is using the same tooling in their manufacturing process that they have been using for the last 40 years. Manufacturers do this in order to save the expense of having to upgrade worn out tooling. They then ""bin"" each unit produced according to how close it comes to design tolerances. In other words, the units that come the closest to design are given a particular model number -- and higher price -- than those furthest out of tolerance. I suspect the T-50s are the units with the most variation from design tolerances while the model T-50PBN, for example, is closer to design specifications. (Thus it gets better reviews and commands a higher price.)

A former great stapler model is now a piece of junk. I think I can hear the sound of ""Taps"" being played in the distance...

...thanks for reading.",3
"Well, now I remember why I don't like this 'classic' stapler.  This looks and feels just like the heavy stapler we all grew up with. The HEAVY one that takes A LOT of pressure to squeeze the handle. I just used it to staple fabric and batting onto some wood to make a headboard. There were four or five misfires and about ten staples that needed to be tapped in with a hammer. That's not as good as my old stapler from a previous project (that stapler has a front squeeze handle which I like better) that maybe misfired a couple of times. For me, the stapler is stuck in the past, too heavy, cumbersome to use, and I don't like loading it because the staples slide around too much. Does it work? Yes. Is it fun to use? No. It's priced well, and if you're not too picky then you'll probably be fine with it. It's just not for me.",3

Which is also the reason I gave 3 stars, when they pull up with no help from me or the environment.

I expected better from a Dymo product.  The tape backing is hard to remove and the tape itself doesn't hold all that well.  I found that I had to cover it with scotch tape to make sure it sticks.  This is ok but another manufacturer's product might be better.,3

DYMO labels are the only game in town for this, and they work great, but they frequently peel off.  Even if you wipe the area down with alcohol swabs first, there's some stuff it just won't stick to reliably.
Dymo and Gorilla need to team up.

(I've used many of the colors, and all are good... I also like the clear... but note that it's not ""clear""... it's more like scotch tape in that it's hazy and not crystal clear.  Also the clear labels are much thinner than regular plastic labels.)",3
is it supposed to leave black ink on the top and I have to remove them myself?,3
"I was unaware until I talked to someone at Dymo that the ""Standard"" labeling tape is barely sticky on purpose. So it can easily be peeled off. If you want something that might last, or something that will be able to wrap around a wire and stick to itself, you need to buy the Permanent labeling tape. The Standard tape won't even stay stuck to itself when pressed sticky side to sticky side around a tiny non-moving wire. It does seem to do okay adhering to a clean flat surface.",3

These paper labels are inferior in many ways to the Dymo plastic labels!  I will only buy the plastic labels in the future!,3

Not sure why there are separations on the label. I must manually adjust each label font in order to print below the separation. :(,3
"These are a convenient way of creating file folder tabs; particularly if you're doing a bunch at a time. These are tab inserts made of an index card-like material, so if you're looking for an adhesive label, this is not what you are looking for. The insert measures 2"" long x 1-1/16"" wide when coming off of the roll. Once printed and separated, fold the insert in half for a 2"" x 9/16"" finished size. I use these in a 1/5 filing tab system, but the inserts are about 1/4"" short. Due to it's shorter length, you lose some additional print area. With the Dymo Label software (I use v8.5.1x) you can print these one-sided or two-sided.

Pros:
- extremely convenient for multiple labeling

Cons:
- about 1/4"" short",3
"I ordered these to label my daughters school supplies but when I received them and attempted to print her labels they were only coming out half printed, thinking my labeler had quit working on me I purchased a brand new one only to find out that it wasn't my labeler it was the labels. I sent them back for a refund and will not purchase them again.",3
"I ordered these labels to help me set up a new office. For several years now, I've used my Dymo Labelwriter 450 Turbo to print larger labels. These labels are for file folders.  My only gripe is that the file folder label runs down the middle of the label carrier sheet, leaving two side label pieces behind when you peel off the actual label. So I use the left-over side pieces to label things using a ball-point pen.  As an example, I use them to label external hard drives, or tools, etc. But it seems a waste to pay for what is really a throw-away part of the label, especially since this roll of labels has far fewer labels than other, larger ones - at the same or higher price. I would have preferred if Dymo had put two labels on each carrier piece.  But functionally, they work just fine.",3

"I set up a free account with Endicia several years ago.  Always bought my stamps on Amazon.com.  But have had problems getting Dymo Stamps to accept the serial numbers, although they were genuine.  Always had to call them and they always waved their magic want and things worked well until the next time.  This time, Dymo Stamps balked before I finished a roll.  So, I jumped through the hoop again.  But, this time they wanted me to send them pictures of the front and back of a strip of the stamps.  When they said it should work, it didn't, so another round of emails was needed to get it going.  I have a new roll on the shelf that they have approved.  But I have no confidence it will work with one or two email exchanges.  When I griped about this, Endicia recommended that I purchase my stamps directly from them through the Dymo Stamps program, as that would automatically approve the roll without me having to enter the activation code.  The ploy is obvious, but what counts is the price difference.  So, here is what I found.  Getting my stamps from Amazon.com with free Prime shipping costs $17.58 for a roll of 200 stamps.  So, I am paying 8.8 cents per stamp for the convenience of printing stamps on demand.  But, I have to jump through hoops to get them activated.  Directly from Endicia, the price is $20.95 for 200 stamps, or 10.5 cents per stamp, an increase of 21% or 1.7 cents per stamp.  I can't speak for you, but for me, the convenience of printing stamps on demand and not jumping through hoops is worth the premium.  My volume is low, so it will not break the bank.  Much as I cringe at giving in to shady marketing tactics, I'll purchase future stamp rolls directly through the Dymo Stamps program.  The only other choice out there is Stamps.com.  I tried them and gave it up because their software is clumsy and they will not print on my Dymo printers.  I love my Dymo printers.  They are rock solid and never need maintenance.  Bottom line in marketing...people will pay anything for convenience.  Yep!",3
Works as intended,3
"How can something as simple and basic as a paper label only earn 3-stars?  The product itself is fine, Ive been using them for years. Likely all of the complaints about quality control is due to the fact that there are so many imitators selling compatible labels and if you try to save a buck you will probably not get the real deal (hint: it seems a lot of the knock-off brands sell their rolls with 350 labels on them rather than the standard 300 that Dymo sells).

My number one complaint is and always has been that Dymo programs their Label Writer product to purposely waste a lot of labels when you install a new roll. There is simply no way you can just drop in a roll and align it and use the first label, or even the first few labels. No, instead they force the machine to feed 3-4 otherwise useful labels first that must be discarded.  That would be bad enough but every single time I replace a roll (and Ive replaced a lot of them) the first two attempts at printing result in an error message, which causes the machine to feed 3-4 more labels and then 3-4 more labels again. So out of a roll of 300 at least 3% of the labels are wasted by the machine  purposely.

Thats such a negative against the name Dymo Im surprised they haven't been audited by the Dept of Weights and Measures.

So bottom line is 3-stars isn't a positive and its not a negative, it just means this is an average everyday consumable that you're forced to buy if you choose to buy a Dymo Label Writer. Or you could choose another brand of printer. Maybe next time I will.",3

"Both of these neon tapes had issues when I first tried making labels. I'm not sure if they were stuck or what, but after I tugged on the end a little and got more tape to come out, both worked after that. The colors are nice and look really neat.",3
"I use a lot of labels in my workshop, and wanted to try out these because of the neon colors. The colors were bright and were visible, but there were some other problems that limited the usefulness of these.

=== The Good Stuff ===

* The bright neon colors worked great in my shop. They stood out against the dull grey steel that makes up most of my cabinets, and the writing showed up crisp and bold (see below). The labels had a reasonable amount of adhesive on them, although I almost always laminate these sorts of labels with a good thick grade of clear tape to protect them.

* Of the two labels cartridges in the box, one worked fine in my labelwriter, the other was problematic.

=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===

* One of the label cartridges was a problem from the beginning. It just did not want to feed correctly, and my label text usually got garbled and mashed together. After about the 50% point, it started feeding just fine, but if I had paid for this cartridge, I would have been furious.

* Compared to the white labels, these are pretty expensive. Not sure that I have an application that really demands that level of cost for more visibility. You might.

* The 10' label length was a bit of a problem. That is not really all that much, especially when you waste half of it just trying to get the labels to feed.

=== Summary ===
If you really need fluorescent labels, these did work fine. The print quality was good, the adhesive worked fine, and they seemed like they would hold up, although I laminated mine as a precaution. For my use, the cost would be somewhat prohibitive. The improper feeding was a bit of a disappointment, and I assume Dymo will fix this going forward.",3
"This was almost a really negative review, but I was able to figure it out.  The problem?  Neither tape would feed in my Dymo 500TS label writer when I first got them.  I have gone through countless tape cartridges in my 500TS, but never had one not feed.  I have no idea why, but neither the green nor the pink tapes would feed when I first installed them.  I googled ""500TS tape won't feed"" and various combinations but found no good explanation.  Finally I examined by good tape and found that I could pull it out easily with my fingers.  Both the green and pink tapes were hard to pull.  As I yanked on them a bit harder, I got about 6"" out and then they started to come out easier.  I installed and voila - the tapes worked.

My only issue is that i spent so long trying to get the green one to work that I messed up the black ink ribbon and it broke.  It now feeds with the tape, so I think that cartridge is useless.

So overall?  The tapes are great shades of pink and green, but I was not happy to have to manually waste tape (and ruin one in the process).  If you get these and have the same problem, just carefully yank on the tape (don't turn the little inner wheel like I did - it turns out that is only for the black ink tape and not the label tape - you might break it).  Just feed out enough tape so it is easy and then install.

So 3 stars - I don't know why these were both stuck, but now you know what to do if they are!",3

I must have got a bad one as the thing would not work when I put it in.  Ended up having to take it apart and re-thread the whole thing to make it work right.  Even then it comes out scratchy.  But like I said it's probably a defect as the one that came with the unit worked perfect.,3

I would reprint the label to try to have it eject from the label maker but it would print one letter on top of the other.  In addition, the ""red"" isn't really red.

"We've used this now a few times and while we like the look of the clear tape, the ink lettering tends to flake off and not stay on as well.  Overall, the printing on the white tape is much better.",3
"How many uses can one come up with for a need of a ""black on clear"" label?  Read carefully before purchasing!!",3
"I got this to go with my DYMO LabelManager 160.  In all it works as advertised.  The print quality was great.  The peel off backing is split down the middle so you'll have two peeled pieces per label.  I find that these refills are on the pricey side for what you get and the manufacturer is taking advantage of that.  Furthermore, if you are into recycling, these plastic cartridges can be seen as wasteful.",3
"For some reason whenever I use two lines the top line is missing some ink. Not sure why, you can still read the lettering but if you are buying these because you have OCD and need things to be perfect and labeled it is frustrating.",3
"After fumbling with the tape dispenser and wasting about 8"" of tape, I finally got it to work. Hope it continues to work.",3
"I only wish the label maker itself had better directions on how to install and set up for the various widths of tape available.  But that is no fault of the replacement tape itself.  The lengthwise split in the backing makes removal of the backing VERY easy.  Additionally, it allows the user to stick the label on across only one half of the label first to make sure it's straight and get out any bubbles or creases - then remove the other half of the backing to smooth the label on the rest of the way.  Very good design.

EDITED: The first tape was just fine, and I rated it 5-stars.  However, I've since been able to obtain and review two of the new ""neon"" colored labels (each 10 feet long), and also recently purchased another 23 foot tape to replace my previous order.  All three of these recently acquired (one purchased - 23' long - and two free as an Amazon Vine reviewer - the 10' tapes) would not feed when I tried to print.  I figured out that if I pulled out a substantial amount of tape, something inside loosened up and the rest of the cartridge fed properly.  But if we're paying for 23 feet (or 10 feet), we ought to get the full amount purchased.  And strangely, you can see the spool of tape inside the cartridge.  There is PLENTY of space on the INSIDE of the spool, yet it seems to be jammed up against the outside of the spool, inside the area where the spool is stored.  Why it doesn't relieve the pressure by unwinding a little from the inside of the spool is unknown - there's plenty of space for that to happen, and that's exactly what happens with the previous 23' spool I got.

So bottom line: just know that you MAY have feeding problems.  You can either waste up to a foot of tape by pulling it out of the cartridge manually, or take advantage of Amazon's superior return/replace policy and just contact them to get another one (and hope that one works).  Once it starts feeding properly - if that becomes a problem - it'll be fine.",3
"I bought this to help organize my dvd's, it would be better IF Dymo made blue tape instead of printing in blue.  It's a bit faded. It does do the job, but perhaps sticking to the black print type would be best.",3
It's okay if a little thin. Would have preferred a pad with more substance.,3
CHEAP BUT WORKS,3
just ok,3
"For the price I guess I shouldnt complain, just wish the underside had more rubbery texture to it...has a tendency so move around while Im using my mouse.",3
spend 50 cents more,3
Okay for office use but shows wear and tear after 6 months.,3
Good for the price,3
okay,3
kinda thin but seems to work well.,3
The surface attracts dust and pet hair which can't be brushed off.  There is no rubber smell like you get with some mouse pads.  I'm not sure that this was the best choice and might try a different mouse pad.,3
"It is okay, but I got it for $2 as an add on item so what do you expect. It works but is very thin.",3
thanks,3
"It is a basic mouse pad, no frills, just what is expected from a basic model.  Would be nice with a bit more friction to the base of the pad, it will tend to slip around if motivated by the user.",3
This seems to work ok (so far) with the Amazon Basics USB mouse in SolydK Linux. But it does not work good with a Case Logic USB mouse in SolydK Linux. The mouse goes apes--t and goes skittering all over the place at random moments. Lifting the mouse off the pad and putting it back on stops the problem - temporarily. I know it's not the mouse because I bought a circular moon mouse pad here on Amazon and it works perfectly on that. So what I did was put the moon pad on top of this one. I originally wanted a plain black mouse pad on my wood desk because just the moon looked odd on wood. But it doesn't seem too bad on a black background. But for that matter I could have put a piece of black posterboard under the moon mouse pad.,3
"The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.

The product description says the size is 9x8
The technical details say the size is 9.5x8
The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75

I guess it's kind of a quibble, but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8"" thick as well.

And, no, I wouldn't buy another.",3
"This is good for a laser mouse, it does what a mouse pad would do.  However, optical mouse won't work well with this solid color pad.  I tested with a new M325 Logitech (optical sensor) mouse I bought from Amazon and a laser Microsoft mouse I already owned.",3
We bought two of these a year ago. One to have just in case the other gave out. in one year of daily use we still have not had to open the box of the second machine. Like i said we use this thing daily. great product.,3
"These thin, plastic sheets are cut to fit the screen of your Palm perfectly, are self-adhesive and remove easily.  The problem is that the texturing, which is supposed to reduce glare and make writing easier, also  reduces screen visability.
Another problem with this product is getting  these sheets to lay down smoothly without any air pockets.  You are  supplied with a credit card-like applicator, but if not applied perfectly  the first time, you can go over and over the thing and the bubbles still  remain.
There is no doubt in my mind that this product will protect the  Palm's fragile screen from scratches, but if you can't read the screen,  what's the point?  I discovered, however, it's very easy to cut the sheets  so they just cover the graffiti portion of the screen, and this is the part  of the screen that takes the most abuse from your stylus.  Using it this  way, you get the advantage of a textured writing surface (very nice) yet  you can still easily view the screen.  Furthermore, you'll get three of  these mini protectors from each single sheet.
Keep in mind that if you  choose to use the method of only covering the graffiti portion of the  screen, and a coin or some other object gets lodged between the case and  the screen, these protectors will do little to keep the rest of the screen  from being scratched.
I think the textured writing surface makes this  product a good bet for most users, and you can start with the entire screen  covered and see if you can live with it.  If not, cut the sheets (as  described above) and I think you'll be happy.",3
"I agree with most of the other reviews here. The writeright reducesvisibility of the screen and is tricky to put on correctly, but adds protection and a better writing feel.
I too have cut the covers into small strips to cover the Grafiti writing area only. Just too much screen degradation for me to keep the screen covered on my Palm IIIxe. But very useful for the Grafiti area - where most writing takes place.
All in all, I wish they made ones specifically for only the grafiti writing area. Also, these are overpriced - but you won't find them cheaper anywhere.",3
"This is a great idea for a product. Especially for those who bear down a bit too hard with their stylus. Unfortunately, light refraction can cause some issues when you're writing on the pad. It does help to decrease scars on the screen, but it can also be very frustrating to work around.",3
"3 stars for now...  mousepad smells like a swamp. I've put it outside to air out and I'm hoping that that happens quickly. Until then, I will keep the old one.  Too bad we didn't know then, that we should buy two and put one away for a worn-out day...  Don't know if it will be too hard, as others have said, since I can't use it until it smells better, but it is the same size as the old one, so I want to put the new pads in the old black holder, because a white holder will look crappy aftere awhile. The older holder is still as good as new, but the wrist pad is definitely worn out...  so here's hoping the swamp smell gets gone.",3
"I purchased this phone system as a package from a local retailer; it contained the base unit model 2420 and two of the handsets, model 2400.
Things I like: sound quality and design appearance.  The phones are  crystal clear all the way from my basement office to the second floor  bedrooms.  The base unit and handsets are sleek and stylish, and the  handsets are unobtrusive in their handset cradles.  I also like the ability  to route fax calls through the unit automatically.  The speakerphone is the  best I've ever heard, loud and clear without the cheap tinniness of most  speakerphones.
Things I don't like are the complexity of the caller ID  and answering machine menus, and the kludginess of the handset menus  especially when transferring calls to another location.  Additionally, the  handset keys are not backlit (although the display itself is backlit,)  making dark-dialing impossible. Similarly, the base unit display is not  backlit.  Combine this omission with the slanted arrangement of the base  unit display, and it is very hard to read unless you have a light shining  directly on it and you are at just the right angle.
All this being said,  I think I'd still buy the phones because their overall functional quality  is excellent.  If Siemens will just tidy up the user interface and remember  those of us who get and make lots of phone calls while half asleep in  the  middle of the night, they will have a real winner.",3
"From the beginning, have had to periodically take out the toner and shake it. It doesn't always print well on the left. Is this really a Brother toner or a refill?",3

"I own a Brother HL-1440 laser printer that I purchased in January 2002. I don't know exactly how many pages I print each month, but it's not a lot - probably 200 or less, on average. The cartridge that came with the printer lasted about a year. In the 5.5 years since then, I've gone through 3 of the TN460 cartridges - about one every 22 months. By my reckoning, that's about 4000 pages, not 6000. Print quality is excellent during the first half or 2/3 of the cartridge's lifespan, but deteriorates noticeably after that. Toward the end, every page is coated with a faint film of toner. Overall, I am not impressed with these cartridges.",3
"quality of print ok at first but the image got weaker as time went on. no longer use because of low quality prints
May be a Brother problem",3
"This toner works fine.  I have printed many pages with it, but I do not have an exact count.  My Brother printer did not use to make a screeching sound, and I do not think it is b/c of the toner.  Laser printers require higher maintenance which I know from my prior experiences in network computing.  Overall, this is a good toner.",3
its okay,3
"We have all of Laurie's CDs and her DVD and LOVE her music. However, this was the latest purchase and it's just not as good as the others.

ok,3
"Gets the job done. If you are the type of person who notices the feeling of paper I would not recommend this. I used this paper for brochures and did not like the feeling of the paper, if that makes sense at all. I actually almost avoided holding the brochures because it almost gave me the nail on the chalkboard chills.",3
"In my HP 880c printer, this cartridge generates beautiful results. On cheap copier paper, even photos print crisply and richly. However, I can't believe how often I have to replace this cartridge. I mostly print text documents with incidental color -- hyperlinks and occasional graphics -- and I replace the color cartridge about as often as I replace the black cartridge.",3
"Quick delievery of HP 23 cart. Ok, the cart I had in there was missing one color.
I looked all over to buy a new cart. No luck. Tried this, it was missing one color and the box was taped up...looked used... With this cart, I have a different color missing now. I took this cart and refilled with a ink refill kit. Still nothing.(not a printer problem)
I believe once the ink has dried up in the head, you are done. I might try and flush with some alchohol,can't hurt the car, then refill again. I bought a new hp printer with the 5 carts, Junk...same old ink problems....<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO MORE HP>>>>>>>>>",3

"I got a Handspring because it was cool.  It has the card-slot (springboard), which is a little limited in what has actually come out for it, but it's a good design.  The deluxe model has 8MB, and this was a good price for an 8mb palm-pilot with an upgrade slot, plus, cool colors.
Then I realized the problem.  The O/S is in ROM, not FLASH.  The O/S on these are Palm v3.1, which is about a year old.  THERE IS NO UPGRADE PATH TO PALM O/S 3.5!  To upgrade, you have to buy a whole new one.
Even if you could, you'd have to wait for handspring's version.
I recommend the Palm-IIIxe, it's the same thing, minus the springboard module (only REALLY useful for a few things, which are easily worked around).  Palm 3xe has 8mb, and FLASH ROM, plus it comes with Palm O/S 3.5 and is upgradable.  If you NEED the cellphone or wireless option, there are sleeves that fit over the pilot that do this.",3

I like it and it worked well...but WHY does this cost more than Lobster per pound??,3
"My Targus Stowaway keyboard for Visor Deluxe seemed to have died over the weekend after eighteen months.  Actually, it was an internal conflict within the Visor.  I had added a jumper wire inside the Visor so I could charge from my hot synch. cradle after a corresponding modification to the cradle....  My Stowaway keyboard worked just like before after making this modification.  Then I downloaded Targus' lastest version of the driver for the keyboard.  A couple of days later the keyboard was completely non-responsive.  I have removed the jumper now.  I later found the real problem was that my Visor was in its final stages of life.  The keyboard does have a nasty habit of ceasing to communicate with my PDA. By experimentation, I learned that a soft reset followed by a warm reset got it going again. The keyboard works well when it works, but too often it does not.  Again, this is probably more of a problem with the Visor than the keyboard.",3
I think the Casio fx series of solar calculators is more intuitive. I don't like the button placement for most of the 2nd functions.,3
"I use the Epson T007201 ink on my venerable Epson Stylus Photo 900. It works well, though I occasionally have to do a ""head cleaning"" run if it sits awhile.

Like all printer ink, it is horribly overpriced. Equally annoying are the ""low ink"" warnings you receive LONG before the cartridge is empty. I can still print out 100+ pages of text after the first warning. As if we weren't getting gouged enough . . .",3
"OK, I agree with everyone that Epson makes pretty good ink.  Photos come out looking good, and they are archival inks as well.  So far so good.

What irks me is that even if I've been overwhelmingly using black ink, when it is used up the printer won't start up until I replace both the black & color cartridges.  In fact, Epson settled a class-action suit because the printer would require you to replace both cartridges EVEN WHEN THERE WAS ENOUGH INK LEFT IN THEM.  So I ended up having to replace both cartridges when there was no reason to replace either of them, so Epson could sell more high-priced ink. What do I get out of it if I send in my claim?  $40 in Epson products, or enough for one set of ink cartridges.

Well, I've bought the last Epson ink I'll ever buy, and the last Epson printer, too.  What's the point of having separate cartridges if you have to change them at the same time?  Epson has nothing to gain by abusing its customers.

I've since replaced my Epson inkjet with a Brother B&W network laser printer that I'm very happy with, and if I want color photos I upload them to my neighborhood drug store, where my photos are ready in one hour for less cost than printing them on Epson photo paper.  If I want a color printer in the future it will be a non-Epson laser printer.  Inkjets are a pain in addition to being expensive in the long run anyway.",3
"If you have an Epson printer, you pretty much have no choice but to buy their ink.  (In fact, this goes any with manufacturer.)  I strongly recommend against using any third-party ink cartridges, as I have had nothing but bad experience with them in the past.
This ink cartridge gives you what you expect: never enough pages for what you pay!  Fortunately Amazon gives us a very good price, so we can afford to buy just a few more per year.",3
Not something I found I wanted to put picture on..,3

Welllll, it doesn't work so great with Inkjet printers. It is better than most, and the photo can be used in a pinch, but overall I will not use this paper unless I have to. I really wanted it to work, so this is a huge disappointment.",3
"Not great quality and just one sided and just so so brightness, the Staples version of this product is much better.",3
it was smaller then I thought it would be but overall was satisfied with the purschase and would buy again if bigger,3
"I purchased this without paying attention to the fact that it is only solar powered - does not have a battery back up.  It requires a lot of light to use.  ---- a lot of time it is on but I can't read the screen.

"This is a great looking calculator and a nicely sized small desktop unit. I bought it for home use. The problem is that it is solar powered only and only under bright light conditions will it work. At home, the calculator will not work or barely display unless directly under a light.

Update 11/04/12. I took it to the office and under standard office light, it works perfectly fine. The digits on the display are dark and crisp. I moved my rating to 3 stars. If it worked better under less than ideal lighting, I would rate it a 5.",3
"The print itself looks great, but when you cut it out and iron it on your white t-shirt, you can see the white background and it looks pretty amateurish.  It also has a rather slick feel to it, but I guess most transfers do.  It probably wouldnt look very good at all on a t-shirt other than white.  But for a quick way to make one or a few custom t-shirts, its very easy, and will get ok results.  Try it out, but use a new, white t-shirt.",3

Just as I expected,3
"These are to laminate 4"" by 6"" photographs, and I imagine are great for that purpose. However, I didn't realize they were solely for photographs when I bought them. I wanted to protect some cards, made of paper, which I have to carry with me. They're not really pouches until you seal the two separate sides together. One side has adhesive, the other does not, so you have to center whatever you're sealing in them so that both sides have an edge to stick to the other side.",3
"Although the pouches were what we wanted, we expected that these would also have had luggage loops. Our goal was to make luggage tags and you need something to attach the laminated tags to your luggage. Other than than, these are just what we needed.",3
"This is an outstanding machine. The keyboard layout is terrific. The one stroke Ans key, and the ability to call up and reuse old expressions are priceless. If it weren't for ONE thing, I'd put my TI-89 away and use the 115MS all the time. (Really tough computations are done on the computer, anyhow.) a) When the 115MS goes off, ALL THE OLD CALCULATIONS are lost, and b) The calculator TURNS OFF AUTOMATICALLY (with malice aforethought!) after a few minutes.

What are you thinking, Casio?? It almost seems as if they deliberately crippled this machine, so serious users would have to buy a more expensive calculator. The problem with that is, the more expensive (eg. graphing) machines are almost impossible to use due to ""creeping elegance"" (an old term that should be resuscitated). There are so many hundreds of functions, the simplest functions get buried under layers and layers of menus.

I can't tell you the number of times I've REALLY NEEDED an expression I put into the calculator a day ago, a week ago, even a month ago. Very frustrating. I have a few minor quibbles with the function set, and the way the editing keys work, but if they just got this one detail right, I'd fork over $100 for one of these babies.

But for now, until somebody gets it right, I'm forced to struggle along with my TI-89 and its creeping elegance.",3
"The calculator works well but has issues with colors used to differentiate secondary and tertiary functions labeled above the keys.
These functions are accessed using either the Shift key or the Alpha key.  The shift functions are colored coded in brown and the Alpha functions are color coded in maroon.  In house lighting, for example in a living room, I found it difficult to tell what color was used on the alternate functions.  The shift functions are listed above the keys to the left while the Alpha functions are above the key on the right.  Some keys however have only one alternate function I found it hard to tell which shift/Alpha key to use.  The calculator has several operating modes ranging from scientific, programmer (hex, octal, decimal), and statistical.  Most operations are performed by entering an equation's values and operations from left to right.  There are a small number of cases however where the operation must be entered right to left.  I was disappointed in the programmer mode since it did not have logical shift left/right or rotate bits left/right.  What it offered was Casio's version a of a shift without any useful application.

The two features that were the most awkward to learn were the ""Calc"" and ""Solve"" equation keys. This is where some operations are entered in right to left which I found confusing.",3
:),3
Works as expected,3
this is my second one of the same calculator and it works the same but I have to say the building quality is much worse compared with my first one which still functions perfectly which was bought ten years ago. the buttons of the new one was shaky and you can see obvious gaps below the keys... the battery lasts really really long due to the solar panel.,3
"I was disapppointed because this calculator has no provision for calculating in other number bases (hex, binary etc)  I mistakenly attributed the ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" etc as being hex numerals. They're not. They're memory locations. No other number bases are possible with this calculator. At $9 it;s not worth returning. I have Casio 115's with number bases on them. I wanted another one but it isn't his one. Otherwise there's nothing wrong with it.",3
ok,3

"Purchased two of these units. One was given to my wife's kid brother, which died within a year of being removed from its blisterpack. Humidity-related? The other was working fine for a couple of years and then I stopped using it for a few years after the novelty wore off. (In retrospect, I should have let my wife's kid brother play with it and waste some tape every so often.) Once the need arose to put it to use again, I installed fresh batteries only to have it power up properly for about 2 seconds. After that, its display stopped working and it no longer functioned. Out of warranty, for sure, so I took it apart and could not find the cause. A real shame that it died (from being idle too long?), because I bought 1/2 dozen tapes for it too. Of course, my only cost effective option ended up being that to trade it in for a new model that now uses different tapes.",3
"I bought this model over others mainly because of its low price (I paid $10 bucks with no rebate hassles).  It turned out to be a decent buy but it becomes obvious that the low inital price will eventually be offset by the high price of label cartridges.

*** Plus Points Include ***

- Easy to use though you will have to read the short manual to understand how to change the font, print size, etc.

- Decent size that is portable yet still highly usable

- Good quality print with a reasonable amount of fonts and borders

- Replacement cartridges have a variety of colored labels to chose from.

*** Negative points are: ***

- It does not take laminated labels so the labels are for indoor use only.

- The labels are always printed with a huge gap at the beginning and end so it wastes a lot of label space (and thus it eats up label cartridges).

- The batteries are a real pain to remove because they are staggered on top of each other

- If you print 2 line lables you cannot change the fonts or size

- As other users have mentioned, it is not easy to separate the label from its backing.

All in all this is not a bad label maker for people who need something cheap and easy for the occasional label or 2 but if you are obsessive-compulsive or need to print a ton of labels you are probably better off spending a few bucks more on something that wastes less of its label cartridge.",3
"In other reviews, I have slammed this product, the m105 and the m125 for what I consider to be their fatal flaw -- a SMALL SCREEN. I returned my m105 (a gift) after a week of squinting.
The dropping prices suggest that the marketplace has spoken loud and clear, and I hope that PALM soon remedies its problems at the low-end of the market with a full-sized screen in a basic unit for under two hundred smackers.
I can't emphasize that enough. With a monochrome screen to begin with, and the built-in difficulty of pointing and clicking on a Palm device, size matters.
However, I have to admit that at these fire-sale prices, the m100 is becoming a steal for folks who have missed out on the PDA revolution because of the cost.
Make no mistake, with a little patience, this is a device that will change your life. After a transition period, you will be able to toss away your Rolodexes (I used to have three) and your paper calendars.
I'd recommend buying a Handspring Visor Deluxe or the new Visor Neo for folks who want a full-sized screen, although they now cost a bit more. They also have an expansion slot for adding everything from memory to a cell phone to GPS. You will also need 8MB (the m100 model only comes with 2MB) if you want to run some of the cooler downloadable programs for your Palm. Three free programs that I use all the time include Mapopolis (free maps from mapopolis.com, streets are searchable), Vindigo (a restaurant and city guide with movie reviews and showtimes at vindigo.com), and Avantgo (a news service where you can get the likes of The New York Times, the Weather Channel and CNN on your Palm).
If you want to stay with Palm, but can spend a bit more, consider the Palm V. Although lacking in expansion slots, it comes in a
super-slim package with a rechargeable lithium battery and a full-size screen. I also have a friend who is very happy with his snazzy, expandable new m505, but in that price range I think a PocketPC might make more sense. Here's a basic product guide:
Palm m100/Handspring Visor -- Bargain basement models with 2 MB of Ram. Good starter models for the price.
Distinguishing characteristics: Visor has significantly larger screen/expansion slot and fast USB cradle. Palm has slower serial.
Palm m105/Visor Deluxe -- Workhorse models with 8 MB of Ram (plenty for monochrome models). Visor has bigger screen/USB/expansion slot.
Palm m125/Visor Platinum -- Upper middle class models. Visor Platinum has larger screen. Both have USB/expansion slot.
Palm V -- Classic, not significantly expandable. Smallest full-function PDA with lithium rechargeable battery.
Visor Prism -- Cheapest and brightest Palm-branded OS, but bulky for its pricetag.
Visor Edge/Palm 500/505/Visor Pro...
Good luck!",3
"I think this is a pda that has too many minus'.... first of all it has a flip cover that is part of unit and is meant to stay on... mine has had to be replaced 4 times by palm for what they consider and admit to be a ""design problem"" ... i was also told by the first rep that i would have to pay for it ...i called back and the second rep offered to send it for free. the other things that i consider to be major problems are the memory is much too low at 2 and the type is much too small... if you have any tendancy toward farsightedness... dealing with this screen would be a nightmare. the stylus does not have a reset pin and there isn't a replacement that has one... really... i have this so that my son can use it for school and i use a handspring visordeluxe. if this was my primary pda i would have a big problem with it.",3
"The best thing that can be said about the Palm m100 is that it looks spiffy and is the cheapest Palm model on the market.  However, the cons far outweigh the pros for this model.
First of all, the ""slightly smaller"" screen is a pretty big problem when you consider that the non-color Palms are hard enough to read to begin with.  The fractional loss of display space makes the m100 more difficult to read than any other Palm out there.
Second, only having 2 megs of memory is a real drag.  One of the best reasons to use Palms instead of Windows PDA's is the huge sofware library available for the Palm OS.  With only 2 megs, you limit yourself needlessly.
In short, I would not buy a m100.  Were I short of cash or if I really wanted the interchangeable faceplates, I would spend the tiny extra amount and get the m105 with 8 megs of memory which puts it on par with all of the other Palms on the market.  However, I think you get more bang for your budget with Handsprings at the $129 to $159 range since you get a slightly faster processor and the expansion port as well as cool colors to choose from.",3
"For many people who are currently jumping on to the PDA bandwagon, you really cant go wrong with this little device. Depending on how you look at it, when it comes to PDA's generally what you pay for is what you get. This holds true for the m100. It will do pretty much everything every other palm will do. The only difference is that you have only about 2mb of storage space compared to the 8mb most Palm units will have now. Also the other main difference is that instead of a cradle, this unit has a plug in type of sync.
Its a great gift to give someone considering how much you can get them these days. Its a great entry level PDA.
As a last piece of advice i highly recommend that you do your research before you go and by any PDA. Dont believe the PocketPC ads or even the Palm ads. Talk to a lot of people and read a lot of reviews, particularly reviews that are made my people like you or me who aren't on Palm's or Microsoft's payroll.(Unfortunately) They will really tell you a lot of things that you will really want to know.
Good Luck! Overall again this is a good introductory palm for those who don't have any type of PDA. Again it really depend on your needs in a PDA. If all you need is a place to write telephone numbers, keep a calendar, a to do list and maybe a few games, this would be adequate. However if you need to view documents, e-books, web clippings, spreadsheets, and even listen to music, you might want to go another direction. Also be prepared to part with a few more dollars.",3

"I bought my first Brother electronic typewriter in 1993. It lasted a decade. I bought my second in 2009. It lasted 14 months. The GX-6750 is fine for filling out forms or creating shipping labels, which is what I primarily used my first machine for. I wrote a novel on my second machine and, during the course of crafting the narrative, I had to replace the daisywheel once (a letter head cracked on it) and, towards the end, was constantly hitting the reset button because the print cartridge would jam in the upright position after correcting a letter or word. Finally, the text became garbled, the key selected not corresponding to what printed when typed.  Hitting ""reset"" didn't permanently help.  Unfortunately, there are very few options on the market today for a typewriter, electronic or otherwise, but I wish I had my old Olympia SM3 back, a manual behemoth that never quit. So, if you plan on using this machine for light applications, it should be fine, but, if not, I don't recommend it.

Pros: Cost; attractive styling; easy-to-replace ribbon cartridges; nicely spaced keys on keyboard; convenient storage nook for power cord; concealed carrying handle; easy to clean with moist sponge or damp cloth; relatively quiet; ribbons and correction tapes available at major office supply chains.

Cons: Pricey ribbon cartridges; doesn't hold up well with heavy use; hard-to-replace correction tapes; can't always keep up with fast typing speeds if italicizing or bolding or correcting text.",3
"I really wanted to wait before upgrading from Vdx, but since my Vdx was acting strangely and I wanted the VisorPhone, too,....I bit the bullet.
I'm moderately satisfied, but unenthusiastic.
PROS:  Bright screen, looks great indoors.  Nicer looking than VDX.
CONS  Color quality is so-so.  Screen is barely readable outside or in any bright light. Huge problem.  I knew I would hate the lithium battery. I do.
BUGS  --I did my first sync to my home computer to Lotus Organizer. Just as happened when I first bought a VDX, it asked me on installation if I wanted to keep my Lotus conduits. I said yes. It overwrote them all anyway, necessitating a reinstall of Easy Sync. Not such a big deal, but annoying.  --MORE dangerous: NONE of my Notepad entries sync'd and they were all wiped out. (Yes, I had them backed up. Wonder how many people won't?) Most of my calendar entries were wiped out, too. Not to mention a couple of hundred address book entries when my data was ""restored"" from backup folders.
Yikes.
MORE BUGS, but not nec Handspring's fault:  I love JOT, one of the most useful add-on programs. It does cause some conflicts with programs that required pen input to perform a function like BDICTY (translation) and AVANTGO (when using form submissions).
With the upgrade to Visor PRISM though, the conflicts were more frequent. City Date/Time, Albums to Go, EyeModule and most anything that had graphical features caused fatal errors. I had to do two hard resets in the first 6 hours before I figured out that JOT was causing the problems. (And thank god for the backup modules....)
CONCLUSION  On the whole, my biggest complaint is the  visibility of the screen outdoors. I think the cons outweigh the advantages here. I had to buy. If I didn't, I would note that is only a modest upgrade for a far higher price from VDX. I would have preferred to wait. If you can...see what's better next year! If you can't, it's a reasonably good product that is, however, overhyped.",3
"As an upgrade to the Visor Deluxe it is obviously the same thing but faster. Noticeably faster than any other Palm device out there, but not really amazing. You will probably only see a big difference in computationally-intensive applications, or those with large databases, like Kanji Hanabi. The speed is the best thing about this product.
The worst thing about this product is the platinum case. Instead of the translucent plastic of the Deluxe model it is a painted gray plastic, and when that paint wears off (and it will) this thing is going to look like a cheap toy that's ready for the trash. The battery compartment cover doesn't fit properly - it rattles. I expect more in a... device.
The clip-on cover is still a problem. Whereas the Palm III series cover flips back on a hinge, leaving a hand free for the stylus, the Handspring cover comes off. You can turn the unit over and clip it on the back, or put it down somewhere, but you have to do something with it before you can write. A clumsy design.
The big thing with Visor is of course Springboard modules. I can forgive the cover for the ability to plug in GPS, Modem, MP3, software, extra memory or even a digital camera or a phone. Palm has nothing to rival this, and now a year after launch some really useful Springboards are appearing, although some are ridiculously priced -... for a 64M MP3 module!
Apart from that... the device is very light (I was surprised to open the shipping container and find it inside, it felt far too light to contain a Visor) and includes batteries, cradle, software CD, brief guide and a few product pamphlets. The feel of the screen is not as smooth or pleasant as that of my Palm IIIe but I expect it will get better with use.
The included software installed and performed a hotsync on my Windows 2000 USB/Office 2000 system without a single problem. USB hotsync is FAST.
Unfortunately Handspring politely declined to help when I asked if I could get a set of translucent plastic for my Platinum. It would be best to see one of these before buying, or be prepared to return it if unhappy. It REALLY feels cheap and nasty.
This will be an excellent travelling email/authoring package with the Targus folding keyboard, RhinoSkin Ti slider case and CardAccess Thinmodem - unless I decide Ihate this plastic so much that I return it for a Visor Deluxe instead.",3
"I have been an avid PDA user for some time, and until recently used a Palm V and Palm m100 exclusively. After using a Visor for two months, I plan to CONTINUE using Palms exclusively.
My reasons?
First, the Visor is significantly larger than the Palm V and even the Palm m100. As a result, it is difficult to carry your Visor with you without having a bag or a very large jacket pocket. Trying to fit the Visor into a pair of jeans is impossible.
Second, the styling isn't nearly as inspired as that on the Palms. The design is more square (I realize the Palm IIIs and the VIIs are square too, but I'm comparing to the V and the m100) than Palms, the buttons harder to push, and the power button harder to use.
Third, the expansion slot really isn't all it's cut out to be. For me, a PDA is a PDA--a replacement for my address book, calendar, to do list, and note pad. It is not an MP3 player, an camera, a GPS locater, etc.--ESPECIALLY if the additional functions never work as well as the ""real thing""!
Please, buy a Palm. They're fantastic.",3
Does not stick well on curved surfaces,3
"It is not what I expected from reading the description.  I expected something solid and heavy that would hold a door in place.  It is not particularly heavy and is a hollow rather than solid wedge. It seems to work all right for the rather light-weight door I'm using it on, but if it  was even a slightly-heavy door I doubt that it would work. Maybe a little high-priced given that it is not solid.",3
Works,3
A little bigger than I expected. It does the job at propping my bathroom door open but has gotten dirty so easy and won't come clean.,3
"Made of rubber that It was okay while it lasted before my dog chewed it up ,now I use a 45 angle chunk of wood that works fine until my dog chews that up as well.",3
"the reason, is it doesn't fit extended space, but refund was great",3
"Works ok. I use this for our call room in the hospital, bought this for safety and privacy reasons, (some people just don't knock, and just swing the door open!!!) So i have been buying door stoppers. I gave 3 stars mostly because it easily slides on hospital floors, so you really have to jam it in and even doing that, doors still crap open. But it is not expensive, so it's ok. So far i bought two types of door stopper, both  just 3 stars.",3
"Not quite a perfect fit on my '03 540i, but I was okay cramming them into the filter box for the price.",3
Okay.  Slips on both carpet and linoleum floor.  Ok to hold the door open as long as the clearance is not too much from the ground.  Otherwise the door slides right over.,3
"Works well overall, but rubber has already broken some on it and leaves pieces of rubber on the floor.",3
"It's not quite as thick and strong as others I have bought.  It is more bendy in the middle when I stick it under a door.  I should have anticipated this, but it also got dirty VERY quickly.  I would suggest a different color.",3
It works.  It does slide on wood floors unless forcefully inserted.,3
"If your looking for cheap then this is what you need to get, If your looking for fancy and attractive this is not it for you.  I'm sure every one has used normal bic pens before, they are exactly the same as the one you normally used.  I personally don't mind  using them, I live with a few people in my house and my pens tend to get lost  quite often. They normal everyday pens.",3
Paper quality is not good!,3
Should have ordered one with more pages.,3
C,3
"Mead Spiral 1-Subject Wide-Ruled Notebook. It is the right product and looks like the picture. Was at Wal-Mart for .70 cents. missed sale and needed it.  Good product, just priced too high.",3
"it takes notes, uses standard paper and generally does what a notebook should. What more is there to say about a note book.",3
its ok. i guess paid too much but it was easy to just add to the shopping cart while i was buying other stuff,3
"I bought a whole case of these Mead spiral notebooks for my kids.  The pages are thin, they aren't perforated, but the price was right (back to school sales) and I'm not expecting much for school notebooks.  My biggest qualm is the wire spiral eventually getting tangled around the holes on the left edge.  It's not neat and pretty after a while and the covers don't sit well then.  They do start out looking nice and I'm not really complaining.

The pages are wide-ruled, good for elementary school kids.  Both of my kids use them and they don't have any issues with them.",3
"our store stopped being able to order staples for the staplers that we had.  we tried a replacement, and it didn't work, so i offered to order them for my work got a pack of 5 (for free shipping) they fit great but the staples are broken into little sections so it takes longer to load them.",3
WORKS WELL,3
"Ok blade, that I have used for around 35 years- before i knew any better. It's a little thick, and does not flex, but did the job. However, these are becoming scarce and the price is ridiculous for 5 blades.
Then, I tried the Olfa art knife with the curved blade, and never looked back. It's thinner, flexi and is a much superior blade to this one, at a third the price.",3
"These replacement blades are great for my Exacto knife and are super sharp, but I wish the container they came in could be reclosed without needing to tape it shut. I wind up needing my Exacto knife when I go to my workshop, and without taping these shut, they will all fall out and cause a serious hazard!",3
as expected,3
"Ok, actually, there were a few times I got stuck accidentally, and it hurt. I didn't like those staples. So far, these staples have been just fine.",3
"these were the only ones which fit the ""pliers"" stapler but when we opened the box the staples were in much smaller pieces, not in full sheets as expected.  hard to use but not worth returning.",3
Very pricey and it took a long time to get here,3
"Was too narrow, but okay!",3
"works ok, could be stronger",3
"Sticks to rough surfaced walls, but is really hard to get off the walls.",3
"This mounting tape sticks very well and is decently priced, however often pulls part of the wall off with it.",3
"The quality is OK, however, i find out a lot of the same product at lower price in 0.99$ store",3
"It did the job, I would buy it again.",3
"did I get a bad batch?? sticking power is very weak this time.  bought this stuff before for same application with no problems.
maybe old tape, maybe damaged by heat?  I don't blame scotch entirely.  chucked it..  used screws.",3
"Good for small projects, but you need a lot of it. I would not use it for anything that weighs over two pounds. Had a few items stay and some fell immediately.",3
NO OTHER RESPONSE,3
Not as good as store bought.,3
Scotch Tape brand used to hold better.  Had to use more tape than I used to,3
"Mixed feelings on this. Worked great initially. But after sitting in my drawer for 6 mos, it didn't stick as well.",3
"Nothing to write home about. I thought it was thicker, but it's just double faced tape. It works for our lightweight project.",3
"This tape must be used on hard surfaces if it is to hold.

I bought a roll of it (at an orange big-box store for the same price as Amazon) to hold the headliner up on a 14-year-old car. It would not stick to either the fabric or the foam-type ceiling where the fabric had released from the front at the windshield. As with the fabric, the tape would not stick to the ceiling covering.

If I had this roll of tape when I attached a solar security light behind the house, I might have something to say in that application. As it was, I used one of those pull-to-remove tapes which did not work on the sheet metal. I ended up attaching the solar light with screws.",3
Not the best 3M product in the world . . . not holding up in the elements. Maybe best for indoor where maximum strength is not needed.,3
I don't know maybe I got it older batch of this but it didn't stick as well as in the past when I have purchased it,3
its ok holds stuff well,3
"Didn't work as well on textured surfaces as I was hoping, but sometimes there's no replacement for super glue. Still has a nice bond and a good feel, but more for a flat surface.",3
generally scotch works on me but not this time. I do not know if I received a defective unit or not. It simply does not hold well. I used it as a mounting tape and it falls down twice within a week kinda disappointed,3
"Initially, this tape is very strong, I have noticed with time that it is not as sticky as when I first opened the package. I use it on mirror and picture frames.",3
It wouldn't be bad if it kept it's stickiness :-(,3
Didn't survive in some areas during the winter,3
okay,3
"12/24/2016 ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT WORK ON STUCCO OR BRICK! Which is what the advertisement says it will do. When you get the package it even says it will not work on this, that it works on smooth clean surfaces.

THOUGH I tried it on brick...and it fell right off. I tried to brush away any loose particles and try elsewhere and it fell right off.

It did work well on smooth, clean surfaces. I attached a big solar motion detector light to a one inch bar of my outdoor staircase and it attached right away, even though the outdoor air temperature was about 50 and I could not press the object on with much weight. So instead of sticking it to my brick walls, and steps...I attached it to the metal bars, and wood rail of my outside stairs.",3
a staple when you need strong doublesided adhesion but shocked to see how much the price has risen.,3
"I hate to give this low stars based on one application alone because i very well may not be using it for its intened purpose.

This tape was purchased to hold child safety locks for our cupboards so we didn't have to drill into our new cabinets. It does not work for that application! As soon as pressure is applied the hardware pops right off. I have not used it for anything else so i can not vouche for its efficency. If you need it for a similar application, this will not do you",3
It's Avery! Can't get their templates to fit their labels? Grrrr!,3
kind of thin,3
Does what it is supposed to and recommended.,3
I have noticed with this batch the glue is not sticking well on brown boxes in the hot weather.,3
Didn't hold up a plastic led light despite cleaning surface.,3
Not as strong as I had hoped,3
It's OK.  Sticks well but it's thicker than I wanted.,3
"Unfortunately you have to pay attention the the product number of 3M tapes...3650 is a low adhesive THIN TAPE  that has no usage in my home or business. Some may find it helpful but for me it is again, another example of cheapening a product beyond is usefulness. I recommend avoiding this POS product. 3M could do a lot better if they would advertise this as a LIGHT WEIGHT LOW ADHESIVE tape.",3
It is hard to peel the red lining off and the tape is not that sticky.,3
"I have been using this for about 2 years now and it has done its job well, but I find myself wanting to buying a new one solely because the way that it collects dust, trapping it inside and making it near impossible to wash out.",3
"Good tape, but over priced.",3
Nice size pad.  I've only had it a little more than a month and noticed the sides are starting to curl up.  I would have preferred a color other than black because it shows dirt rather quickly.,3
I'm not sure what the issue was but the tape would not stick on some boxes and it seemed to be a lighter weight then what I was expecting. It worked ok for the most part but not always.  There were some boxes that we could get it off of so I guess it worked out evenly.,3
Didn't do the job at all.  Claims to hold up to 5 lbs.  but it did not.  Disappointing.,3
"This one is all right. However, I prefer the Scotch Extreme Mounting Tape. That one is stronger (as the name indicates). If you are not sure if the tape will be strong enough to serve your purpose. Get the Scotch Extreme Mounting Tape instead. This one is really just for light use.",3
Not nearly as strong as advertised,3
"This is thinner than what I normally get. The inner paper rolls say ""packaging tape"" but the photo here shows moving and storage. I will pay more attention next time and make sure I'm getting the thicker ones. Not sure if the photo matches what I received.",3
Doesn't work that well,3
"This device is good enough but as is happening with imports, materials are too light and imbalanced.",3
Not all labels are aligned properly but I was able to choose what is good.,3
Online description was accurate and am satisfied with my purchase.,3
Smaller than I expected,3
jammed sometimes,3
"Online description was accurate, items were received promptly and am satisfied with my purchase.",3
not as good as others seems to be made cheaply,3
It`s a little flimsy,3
"While I am not happy with this, it is mostly because the perception was that these would be bigger, based on them being listed as standard size mailing labels, however as I was unable to get a good idea of the size that is on me as well.  I did find that it is VERY important to use the right software (which I found to be a challenge to find the correct number to use to locate it) and that you need to insert it into the paper tray the direction they say or it will not print properly.
I wish they would put a warning on here that you will need to have a computer with internet access in order to get the above mentioned software.",3
Just another mouse pad.,3
"Nice, but I like the smaller Tape mounted in it's own cutter for convenience.",3
ok,3
The quality of this item is ok. But gets really dirty fast from usage. But worth the price.,3
It's a mouse pad !!,3
It didn't hold my bumper up like I wanted it to. It is what it is.,3
"thick compares to other brand, but very small, quality seems ok, but not like my expectation. I end up buying another brand for $10, it's worthy",3
Works for what is needed.  The label templates can be tricky (though it could also depend on the printer itself as well),3
"Good value but noticed that it doesn't stick well after a while.
I taped up a couple of boxes for shipping and left them for 2 days and I noticed the tape start to give way. I had to re-tape some areas so my boxes didn't open during shipping.",3
The tape was not as strong as I was expecting and getting the backing off the other side is a little tricky.,3
Labels have a tendency to pull off in the printer. Yikes!,3
"Dymo is shooting itself in the foot with outrageous prices.  They need to realize that they would sell a lot more product if their prices were more in line with competitors, especially since the materials used are the same.  Only gave 3 stars because of pricing.  The product itself is good, but no better than generic versions.",3
"The labels are nice quality paper but the middle connector section is too small to wrap the tag around our jewelry products such as rings and bracelets etc.... We ended up using the tags but they get glue on the jewelry which is a hassle for our customers. We have decided to order a more professional label maker with ""real"" jewelry dumbbell tags that have a longer middle connector to fit our products. These tags are decent, but for super tiny items only... not practical for tagging jewelry. I wish dymo would have made the middle section longer and the printable area smaller.",3
"So I bought a cheaper brand labels and while they printed great if you hit the reverse button they jammed.... I figured that buying the dymo ones for the dymo printer would make a difference.... Nope they jammed as well.  They print great but they definitely jam to easy.  Also, these are not convenient to use to label necklaces or earrings, only rings because the tail is too wide.",3
Works great but it's a bit of a hassle to separate from the backing.,3
Didn't hold as well as I remember mounting tape working in the past.  My powerstrip fell off under the weight of the cords--and with out any bricks on it at all.,3
"I have no idea why I got this but it does work, is fairly long piece, over time, I will use. probably to mount some cute little LED hallway lights or something. i believe it is fairly sticky, has million uses, of which i will never see in this lifetime.",3
ok,3
"This is fairly sticky, but wasn't quite as heavy duty as I was hoping for. It seems to work for the most part, but I'm just not sure the longevity of it. Good price though.",3
"Pros:
- outdoor weather resistant
- not permanent, no drilling needed
- easy to use
- affordable, less than four dollar for 60"" tape
Cons:
- not ideal for desert weather, hot and dry
- it fell off after two months, don't use for fragile stuff

"This mouse pad had an awful smell when I first opened the bag that it came with. Couldn't use it for the first few days. Once I let it air out, it's a decent mouse pad for the price. I paid $3.99 with free shipping.",3
I like Avery's product. But this one couldn't be printed out accurate. I use word and put label code on it to print. But come out without on right space for the right 2 rows.,3
They seem to be ok but sometime when you type on them the print is not always on line when you print them out.,3
Good replacement but VERY thick. I prefer a thinner mouse pad.,3
Labels are great but software didn't work well with Windows 10. Guess they haven't update their product for new operating system.  Printed labels fine but when savings and reopening everything was gone and had to start over.  Couldn't find an update for the software on their website.,3
It is a mouse pad,3
"I bought this so I can design my own return address labels.  I was already to start using this, but, then I received yet more return address labels from some unknown company.  I don't believe I have ever bought return address labels because I keep getting them in the mail.

Once I actually run out of the free ones I will start using these.",3
Labels seem to be ok in spite of the fact that Avery places a shelve life of 2-3 years. These labels had a brochure enclosed for a contest that expired 10 years ago. They were worth the price so far.,3
"Not the best quality for my prupose. I wanted to use it to label some bottles, but it doesn't hold ink especially well which causes some fringing on the edges of prints, which isn't good for having bright colors near darker colors as they appear blurry wherever they touch. That being the case, they still are a good enough product for labeling packages and that sort of thing, assuming you aren't trying to put something too elaborate on there.",3
Tape we received had a yellow hue to it--not clear.  We also ordered the same kind of tape with a dispenser at the same time and that was crystal clear.  This looked old. Use it to cover prescription labels.  It didn't cause fading of the label print so it's usable.,3
It's o.k.,3
Very light weight and shipping took more than two weeks. But its a mouse pad and it works. You get what you pay for and this was cheap,3
"The mouse pad itself was very good quality. It was true to size and worked very well with my mouse. However, the mouse pad stunk! It smells very strongly of burnt rubber and chemicals. I'm not sure if this happened to everyone or just me. And thus far I have not found anything to get the smell to go away.",3
"It wasn't strong enough for my project, but it might work well otherwise. I was trying to use it to restick some baby proofing items to my cabinets. It did the trick at first, but eventually my toddler overpowered the ""stick."" That said, he overpowers everything.",3
Faulty tape cutter.,3
"I love that it is removable, I'm a little concerned about how long basic photos will last up on my regular painted wall though.
Update. Most photos move or get at least partially dislodged within a few weeeks.",3
peels off time to time,3
"I like the tape, it is strong, clear and does its job well.

My only problem with it is the red lining tape, if you don't use the tape up within a few months the red lining tape becomes brittle and sticks to the clear tape in tiny pieces.  You have to remove it from the clear tape, but that becomes very difficult and time consuming because it sticks hard to it.  That would be OK if it stayed in one piece, but the red lining tape sticks to it in tiny pieces which have to be picked off with a pair of tweezers... which is a hassle.

Get it if you plan to use the entire roll, but don't expect the last half of the roll to be usable after several months without a great deal of hassle.",3
"Priced too high, when I can get 6,000. $38.00",3
The rolls have less tape on them than I expected. I will not order again.,3
Poorly made didn't last. Comming apart at the edges.,3
"Trublock Technology is a gray coating on the adhesive side of the label so that it is more opaque and covers what is underneath. If this is important to you than it's an added bonus. Otherwise, not an essential quality.",3
"I wanted to use this to mount a utensil rack so I wouldn't have to drill holes.  When I got it, I found that the tape could not hold the rack because of the weight of the utensils.  I was disappointed.  (I'm going to try my commercial strength adhesive velcro.  That usually holds anything.)

The instructions on the back state:
4 inches of tape for every 1 pound of weight

So measure the space that will sit FLAT on the surface to determine if there is enough surface space for the amount of tape you need.  In my case, there was only about a half inch of surface space on each end, thus it would hold only 1/2 pound with this tape.

Hope this helps.",3
This tape seems to have a more difficult time adhering to cardboard than most of the other packing tapes I have used.,3
"Good tape, press it down to make sure it adheres well. I've had to reinforce some runs of tape. I'll try a different brand next time.",3
"This should be advertised as ""sickly packaging tape"", because it didn't show up to work on my packages, and it literally fell off 1 day later like an employee too lazy to even tell you he quits the 2nd day. This is the weak acrylic stuff, and I think most of us meant to purchase the ""heavy duty (20x stronger than acrylic)"" packaging tape instead. But even still, this is advertised as ""packaging tape"" and it's completely unfit for this purpose.

Update from 1 to 3 stars: 3M sent me replacements. I can't really argue with the brand. The tape is apparently designed for long term storage, which the heavy duty tape runs into some issues with (yellowing of tape for example), ""flagging"" of the tape, and extreme temperature variations; hence the use of acrylic.",3
So so on adhesion. For sealing the top of a box temporarily it works well. It is not ideal for using as a tape to put together shipping boxes though.,3
This mouse pad stinks (literally). My optical mouse sometimes gets confused on the flat black mouse pad surface and I have to lift it off and set it down again.,3
great old school mouse pad.  soft top so it works with any kind of mouse flawlessly.,3
"Decent labels, a little overpriced",3
Works great for posting signs around school.,3
...but not as strong as I would have liked.,3
"Scotch Exterior Mounting Tape, 1-Inch by 60-Inch.. I haven't used this yet. But the Brand name of Scotch. I be surprised if it doesn't work well.",3
It is what it is and does it's job. After about 6 months of use it's showing wear and tear already with the top edges curling off.,3
"Good for light and small posters, but not for larger ones. Even if you use more tape it just comes off eventually. Had to switch back to the poster-ripping command strips. I wish there was something out there that wouldn't mess up your posters after use.",3
Wish it were taller.,3
as described,3
"Edit: It has been a few months and the smell really has not gone away. It is funky but I still use it sometimes. Had rated it 5 stars when I thought the smell would dissipate. Now rating 3.

Simple mouse pad. Black. All that I could have asked.

As many other reviews have stated this mouse pad smells like a bicycle inner tube. It is quite strong. Despite this I like the mouse pad. I am going to try washing it with dish soap and letting it dry. In time I think the smell will leave. For the price I paid for it I am willing to do a little work to get it to the place I want it.

It doesn't slide around on the desk and helps my older mouse read well. It is low-key and not an eye sore. I have had issues in the past with mouse pad liners coming apart from the base of the pad, this one looks well bonded and resisted my attempts to roll it off.
Does the job without getting in the way. Would buy again as long as I am able to get the smell out.

(photos: 1) the bottom of the mouse pad, 2) the mouse pad as compared to my 13inch macbook pro, 3) mouse pad as compared to my old apple mouse)",3
"Whats in the box: 300 business cards, on a row.

These labels are great for appointment cards, and raffle tickets. I use them on a daily basis. The setback is that they are quite expensive. I would also add that the cards do NOT always tear straight, or neatly.

For: offices, appointment cards, business cards, raffle tickets, etc",3
"Super cheap, flimsy foam mouse pad but it gets the job done.",3
"The trick to using this tape seems to be figuring out how to get it out of the dispenser without crumpling it up. For me, this has been quite a bit harder than with regular Scotch double-stick tape.

On the bright side, thus far I have in every case managed to eventually get the tape out of the dispenser in useable flat smooth condition, thanks to its being thicker than regular double-stick tape, and enough less adhesive that I was even able to uncrumple and use the strip that ended up in a ball at first. This tape also held a large (2' x 3') poster well but remove-ably for me on a painted wall.

Even so, I much prefer hanging most things on walls that can't be marred by using Scotch Command Strips rather than this or any other solution I've found thus far.",3
"This is a basic gel-like wrist pad that should work for its purpose. Most disappointed is the gel. It's not as jelly, feels very flat.  Facts: The width is about the same as keyboard, but the pad is  about 3/4 inch thick (much thinner than expected as my current wrist pad is over 1"" thickness.)  The bottom of the pad seems to have a material that makes a crinkle plastic sounds when moves. The top of pad where your wrist rests is flat.",3
"Had a really really bad smell when first opened. Other than that, its a mouse pad that's really cheap. Don't expect much.",3
The tape is thin and does not stick as well as Duck tape.,3
"I like to make 20x30 enlargements and put them on light (not heavy) foam poster board.  The trick is trying to hang or otherwise affix them to the wall.  It may be the type of paint on my walls, but this stuff does not work well in my home.

I tried it once a long time ago and just recently decided to try again.  Who knows, ""Maybe I'll have better luck this time,"" I thought.  My wife scoffed as I proudly joined her for a night's rest.  ""Have faith,"" I said, ""It won't fall down this time.""  As I peered through the darkness, I noticed that the wall seemed whiter than it should - at least where I placed the poster.

""Never mind - it fell down already,"" I said.

This is not to say that it is a bad product (all the time).  Just know that it doesn't work in some cases.",3
"It sticks, it works as described and seems to last.  $5 for 60 inches is too expensive but that is a competitive price for this junk.",3
its tape,3
"I cut a 1"" square to hang a hook on my shower wall to hold a back brush. I followed the directions to the letter. I didn't let it get wet for 48 hours after applying it to the wall and hook. It held for 3 days before the hook fell off.",3
The glue holding the fabric on the gel is terrible. It's all filled with air holes and wrinkles. Does the job. Just ugly now.,3
"It rolls out smoothly in my dispenser and is easy, easy, easy to handle.  Its almost too easy.  I worry that it'll come off.  I had to take some off to get into my box and it came off like a breeze.  I don't want it to come off in transit. It was starting to come off the bottom of a box that was stuffed full and required a few more rounds of tape.  We'll see how it performs as the boxes travel from truck to storage facility, to cargo hold, to storage facility, to moving van, to our new home in Hawaii.",3
Good value,3
"Not sure what everyone is going on about as far as the ""smell"" of the mouse pad.  I have a good sniffer and detected nothing malodorous.  My biggest complaint is that it doesn't have enough weight to it to make it hold still.  I had to tape it to my desk.  Other than that - it works just find",3
"I have had this for about a year now and it is coming apart in more places than one. The shiny cloth cover came off a few months ago, this month the rest of it falling apart. Has worked great until then.",3
the tape when printed gave out a choppy printed label so teh quality is medium,3
"Fast shipping , wasn't Polyester tape but I kept anyway and used it..Worked ok.",3
Cloth curled up (separated) within months,3
"I don't know why the description has ""premium"" in it.  But if you like plastic pads (hard laminate) then this will work out for you.  And as an add-on for $2 you can't go wrong.",3
long-lasting?  you have to know when to use this and when to use the heavy-duty kind if you want something fixed somewhere for a long time.,3
i bought this mousepad strictly for the price - it is not the best one since the mouse slides all over the place but it is good enough as a back up - would not purchase this style again because i like  a pad that is more spongy. just to be clear it does its job - it is just not my favorite kind of mousepad.,3
kids like story BUT while i really wanted a board book this one is just so small.  wish larger,4
"Bought this used and it came in great condition, almost like it had never been read. The story isn't as good as the original corduroy but my husband had this version as a child so had to add it to our daughter collection",4
Fits the Bible well.  I wish it was more secure though.,4
"That being said ...
I do like that it keeps all things easily @ hand ...
I do use it all week to study me Sabbath School Lesson ...
I use it also on a weekly basis to carry lesson & Bible to church ...
It is good in theory ...
Needs to be a bit firmer in construction ...",4
"I love this cover! I am tired of my kids destroying bibles and their bindings. This cover works well and my daughter loves the pocket on the front to keep a pencil/pen/stickers, etc.

My only complaint is that the Adventure Bible Junior Bible does not fit in it very well. The bible very easily falls out if the kiddo tries to pick it up when it is unzipped. This is frustrating, but overall it serves its purpose and will work better when she gets the older kid Adventure bible.",4
My daughter likes this backpack type Bible cover.  She is able to put some pens and a little notebook in the pockets.  The cover does protect the Bible.,4
"My kid loves this cover.  Love the pockets and the strap.  It does a good job protecting the Bible.  Only problem is that it doesn't stay on the Bible as well as some other covers I have had.  Which is very odd because it was made for the Adventure Bible - which is what we have it on.  It is just a little too big.  When the Bible is closed it stays on fine.  When you go to close your Bible, that is when it can slip right off.  Not every time, but enough that it annoys me.  Doesn't seem to both my kid though.",4
Seems to be rip-stop. Fits true to size.,4
"This cover is great for kiddos who continually break bibles and their bindings! My kids love the  pocket in the front. It's a great place for stickers, pen, pencil, etc that they get from church.

I do not like that the Junior Adventure Bible does not fit in it well. My younger kids pick up the case with the bible without zipping it and it falls right out. I'm not too worried about it because I always try to double-check to make sure it's zipped, and it works well with the older kid Adventure Bible so they can grow into it.",4
"I bought this for my 8yo's adventure Bible to help keep it clean and protected.  The material does seem a bit cheap, but it looks nice enough and he likes it, which is what really matters. He LOVES all of the many pockets. There's always a place to keep whatever they've given him at church that day. He has one of the Adventure Bibles that clasps shut, which means we weren't able to take advantage of slipping the front and back covers into the case. Instead, he just clasps the Bible shut and places it in the case. That's fine though, it'd be that way with any case he got for it. It'd be hard to read it in the case anyway when he's got the pockets crammed full of stuff. The handle seems pretty secure, but I guess I could see that the material it's attached to could rip if it were treated casually. I've told him that he can carry it by the handle, but I've asked him not to swing it around by the handle because other reviewers have said it can fall off easily. So far, so good. All in all, nice case to fit the Adventure Bible.",4
"Purchased for my son to use when carrying his Scout Book. It's mad wit through numerous camping trips - including a week at summer camp! Zipper and velcro hold up very well! Nice feel with handle and ample inside room - including a space for a pen/pencil. Only complaint was the compass - the clip broke about week two and compass was lost. Not a big deal as my son uses a better quality compass anyway but if you're buying it for the compass, I'd suggest placing it in a pocket or adding a sturdier hook.",4
I should have read the dimensions. This is a lot bigger than i expected. I love all of the pockets and the fact that you can take the bible cover out and use it just like that as well.,4
"this is a cheaper product, but it will still protect the bible from wear and tear. I cannot complain about it.",4
"Did not fit the Bible I bought it fer ...
Yes I checked the measurements ...
However I liked it enough that I kept it  ...
And put it on another Bible I had",4
A very nice Bible Case that I used to replace another one that was damaged.,4
"Love this cover! It's well made, it's sewn together and honestly I expect it to last me a very long time. I'll edit this or post in the comments if I have any problems so if you don't see any here, then know it's still going well.

The only thing I don't like, but fully expected for the price, is that I believe this to be faux leather. Still, it's not cheap plastic or vinyl. This feels very durable. I'm very confident in saying this.

I bought it to go with my new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Large-Print-Life-Application-Study-Bible-NIV/dp/1414359764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Large Print Life Application Study Bible (NIV)</a>&nbsp;in hardcover. It fit perfectly well. I wrote a review on that Bible and the link will be in the comments, if you're interested.

This particular size does fit that Bible very well. I mean, as I put it in the other review, it fits it as snug as a bug in a rug. I couldn't have been more pleased. Just keep in mind that I don't think a soft cover will work well with any Bible cover. They get more and more flimsy as the years pass.

There isn't much more to say except that I'm very excited to own this one. I totally love it.",4
"This is a wonderful design. It has everything you could ask for with a student calendar...and it is bright and colorful.  However, unless velcro is added to each piece or push pins are used, there is no easy way to change the calendar every month.",4
"The calendar is perfect for your home school classroom.  It helps teach the little ones the days of the week, months, weather, etc..My only wish is that this was velcro/magnet. I have push pin holes everywhere.  One day in my ""spare time"", I am going to put the little velcro on the back of each piece and on the calendar.",4
"This is a good little calendar set. I laminated the school house with contact paper to make it more durable. As well as the months, weather, etc. I did not laminate the days and special days squares, because there were so many, but I would recommend it if you can. The illustrations are cute and colorful, and it like the school house design as well.",4
My students enjoyed using this chart on a daily basis.  But the red arrow doesn't stay in place.,4
Granddaughter liked!,4
"I ordered this and the learing to swim book last year.  I probably needed to raise a star on my other review, but apparently my niece would be angry and defiant after watching Pepe, they cut her off of it, and she's her cute sweet self again ( most of the time). Books are ok, I guess I don't know about the tv show though. My niece is going into princess stuff now anyway,",4
Purchased to add to a Peppa Pig gift bag.  It was a big hit.,4
gift for granddaughter,4

I have been slowly adding some of these Peppa books to her collection, as she loves to be read to. She also loves swimming so I knew she would enjoy this one. She knows all the characters, and loves pointing them all out. This book is cute and colorful, however I personally thought it was lacking a little bit as far as the variety of pictures. Each page is pretty much the same with the characters in the pool, with some slight variations. However, as you can tell from my video this book has been well loved in just the couple months that we have had it. My daughter wants us to read it to her over and over, and she carries it around with her all the time looking at the pictures. So although the pictures are a bit repetitive to me, my daughter loves it and that is what matters most. There are 23 pages total not including the cover page, and there are just the right amount of words on the pages to tell a nice story without losing her attention. Overall I like this book, it just isn't my personal favorite in the series. I still would recommend it to anyone with a child who is a Peppa fan. This was a personal purchase bought at the full retail price. I am reviewing it solely to share my experience with other potential buyers.",4
Up in my classroom right now.  Refer to it daily for spelling the words and PV.,4
Very tall border.  I use it to cover the rubber molding at the bottom of the walls in my classroom.,4
"It serves it's purpose.  It's a little flimsy, but to homeschool my pre-kindergartener it's fine I suppose.",4
Wished it was a little more durable maybe laminated,4
These are cute signs that are helpful in class.,4
"Nice easy to use, wish there was a little more velcro to secure. But overall not to big or to small.",4
I really like this board. I just think it is a little pricey. But I bought it along with some magnetic money and we also already had magnetic letters and numbers. My six year old son is having a lot of fun and learning using all of these things together. I would recommend it for a learning tool.,4
My little one loves this,4
Eventually after several erases the board doesn't seem to erase as easily and cleaner must be used to get the shadows from previous writing off.,4
"It works.  But here are my pros and cons.

Pros:
* easy to set up and put away
* holds the little magnetic letters

Cons/complaints:
* cardboard-like, but not dollar-store-like
* not metal
* magnets don't slide, but you don't get that strong magnet feel you'd enjoy with a metal board
* not confident it will last, but it's not flimsy

Bottom line: it will last just fine for toddlers learning letters or for using magnetic icon cards, but put it away after use.  I probably should have gotten a nicer tabletop easel like M&Doug brand to last, but this one is OK.",4
My great grandson 16 mos old loves placing the magnetic animal s on the board. The board and animals entertain him so he no longer plays with refrigerator magnets (great way of keeping him out of the kitchen).,4
"Magnetic board holds ok, but not as well as our kitchen refrigerator. For small words and sentences this should work well. I have already figured out that I need a much larger board. I tried both the Melissa & Doug Magnetic Wooden Alphabet and the foam magnet alphabet and they both work.",4
"I was going to mark this 3 stars, but I imagine for the price you're not going to find anything like it. As a Special Educator who moves around and pulls small groups I love the concept and design, but the magetic pull isn't very strong (light plastic letters slip a bit) and the dry erase isn't as erasable as it could be. But for a portable table top workspace it's pretty good. Just remember NOT to leave any writing on the board, erase it immediately to prevent stains and permanent marks. If you can, use the flat magnetic letters rather than the letter shaped platic pieces.",4
These are great little books for stocking stuffers.  Definitely decorative and catch the eye.  As far as functional I don't know as I gave the ones I bought away as stocking stuffers.,4
"Got this in the mail yesterday and was very happy. When I ordered last week ... there was no sourcing fee. For 1.50 it's a very unique/compact/easy-to-carry notebook. It's thin enough to fit inside a purse and can be used to jot down ""to do"" lists or whatnot but it's too small for journaling. I've ordered several more notebooks from the publisher and can't wait for them to come! Wish Amazon would carry more of these notebooks because there are some stunning ones featuring the paintings of Renoir/Degas/John Singer Sargent. All for 1.50 or less. These make excellent stocking stuffers and I cant imagine a ""girly girl"" or sensitive guy would be disappointed to receive one. Im happy with the quality and will buy the William Morris address book ... if there's no sourcing fee.",4
nice,4
"It's a nice little notepad, I like to keep one in my purse and this fit great. I like how the pages are blank instead of lined so I can doodle in there, too.",4
"Very pretty butterflies, but the notebook is very small ... more like a note pad. I gave it to my daughter because she likes butterflie decor ...",4
"It's my fault I'm disappointed.  I didn't read the discription.  I saw Butterfly and thought it was a book on butterflys, not a note pad.  Always read before buying.",4
I got this when it was $1.50 because my other purchases were just under $25 for free shipping.  I used it as a party gift.  Nice to keep in your purse or car for when you need to jot something down.  I would not pay $3.49 though.  You can get 3 or more little notebooks for that price at office stores.,4
"This is a great size wall map. I would make sure to get the roll up version if planning to put it on a wall. It is very thin, very much like cheap copy paper- so we put clear contact paper over top it to provide protection and durability. The color and printing is great though.",4
Wall map works great and is as expected. 32X50 size.,4
Great map; very large.  Measure space where you expect to hang it to see if it's the right size for your needs.,4
first shipping wound up lost as it was in a much larger package which was nearly fully opened by the time It got here.  No fault of the map.  It is good color and paper.  For the price very acceptable and I am glad I have it.,4
"This map of the United States is printed on light-weight paper that would not withstand a lot of wear, especially if it was folded and unfolded much. However, it suits our purpose is planning a month-long auto trip starting in South Carolina going west along the south and then swinging back east along the northern states. We are placing small stickers on the map to mark out places of interest. The map is certainly worth the small Amazon price.",4
My children and I really like this map. I wish it was laminated because the paper isn't that thick and I know it will get destroyed. Think I may have to get creative and try covering it with clear shelf paper.,4
"It took me a while to discover that my kids were not going to learn any geography in school.  About the time my 10 year old asked me what the capital of London was, I started shopping for maps.

Because the world changes so rapidly now, I decided to order maps large enough for a 6 and 10 year old to look at and comprehend, but cheap enough to be replaced once the borders of various countries are re-done.

The positives - this map is correct, it's large (we tacked them up in the hallway to the kids' rooms) and it's very colorful, which is good for 6 year olds.

The negatives - it's not laminated, now if I was buying this for myself that would be fine, but the paper is also some strange form of paper that attracts and holds small sticky fingerprints.  Being maps, little fingers are naturally attracted like magnets.

If you are making the purchase for an adult or a classroom, or if you intend to frame it, then I highly recommend this map.  If you are buying for little ones, I'd spend the extra money to get a laminated version.

One last note - if you purchase from Amazon, they are not particularly well packed.  They put them in a tube that is too large for the map so it bangs around and the ends get a bit bent up.  Also they don't tape the ends of the tube so I had to have a second one sent after my first tube arrived empty and without ends on it.",4
ok,4
"Good, it's a huge size thing tho",4
"I love geography and like to have a map handy to look up places around the world. This is a nice big map, fits well on my office wall  and it is colorful and well laid out. I use pins to point out a few locations I have traveled to and  also to highlight areas of interest (for example far flung regions that suddenly because headline news for one reason or another that nobody seems to have heard on)

A decent buy for the price!",4
Fun and informative. This hangs on my child's wall and when they go somewhere we put a sticker on it,4
Wanted to show my visiting friend from overseas just how big the United States is compared to their country. This was a very helpful aid. Excellent quality and size.,4
"Good quality poster. Nice and big.

Came slightly buckled.  Needs better packaging.",4
Make sure you measure out what 50x30 really is because it doesn't sound that big but it's really huge! There are no frames you could buy to fit this. Which was fine for us for our purpose. Really nice map but really big.,4
"This is a very nice map, especially for the price.  (Paid $10.17)  I was expecting just a regular paper map, but was happily surprised when it arrived to discover that it is made of a higher quality material.  Not laminated, but lightly plasticized (if that's a word).  The colors are rich, the detail good for a map this size (not too little, not too much).  Very pleased with this purchase.",4
"I like it. Size of the map meet my expectation. Easy to look. Big printing, especially cities' names. Color is little bit dark. Lighter is better.",4
very good detail on this map for this price. lamenated coating is a plus. great for planning trips or just learning about our country.,4
"Got it as a simple gift to a friend. he liked it.. Good product and worth the money, specially it has some nice details for the cities.. the capitals... etc",4
"I've wanted a large U.S. map for awhile now and saw this one. It was laminated, large,cheap, and has useful info on the map. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the ""lamination"" if you chose to call it that is very thin. I'm going to take it to my local print shop and have them laminate it with the thick stuff so it won't get wrinkles or any tears/damage.",4
"I purchased this and the ""World Map"" together from Amazon, since they are made by the same company on the same material, much of my review will be the same:

I was hunting for maps large enough for a 6 and 10 year old to look at and comprehend, but cheap enough to be replaced once things change or the kids did too much damage to it.

The positives - this map is correct, it's large (we tacked them up in the hallway to the kids' rooms) and it's very colorful, which is good for 6 year olds. It has time zones, capitals, waterways, and mountain ranges all clearly marked

The negatives - it's not laminated, now if I was buying this for myself that would be fine, but the paper is also some strange form of paper that attracts and holds small sticky fingerprints. Being maps, little fingers are naturally attracted like magnets.

If you are making the purchase for an adult or a classroom, or if you intend to frame it, then I highly recommend this map. If you are buying for little ones, I'd spend the extra money to get a laminated version.

One last note - if you purchase from Amazon, they are not particularly well packed. They put them in a tube that is too large for the map so it bangs around and the ends get a bit bent up. Also they don't tape the ends of the tube so I had to have a second one sent after my first tube arrived empty and without ends on it. (It was actually the world map that was missing from the tube, but this one was packed in the same manner)",4
"Excellent map with (as expected) very high-quality printing. I was surprised at how thin (and thus easily wrinkled) the map is, but it came rolled in a tube that protected it well.

I'm holding back 1 star for the following reasons:
- Much thinner than expected; even with the lamination, no heavier than some inexpensive folded paper maps I've gotten in the mail.
- After laying flat on the floor weighted down with heavy books over most of its surface for 48 hours, it still insisted on trying to re-roll itself while I was trying to glue the backing board on.
- There's a fairly large ""border"" of laminating plastic that extends beyond the actual map on all four sides. Depending on how you're using the map, it could be helpful or simply get in the way; I had to trim it off because it went beyond the measurements given & got in my way.
- Although not a problem per se, the laminating plastic is VERY glossy so (even though it's crystal-clear) at some angles there's a lot of glare on the surface.

I bought the map for a mid-scale test of a much larger (planned) fiber-optic travel map, only I'm using it with regular map pins to save money. I found the best backing board to use was a foam board with a thin layer of cork on one side; it attached relatively easily with spray adhesive (although I braced it with 2 pieces of cheap wall moulding cut to length). As you can see from the closeup, it stands up well to being used as a pincushion. However, if you look closely at the full-map photo where the finished project is hanging on the wall, you can see from the way the light reflects off the plastic that even with lots of spray adhesive & heavy books holding it flat on the floor for several hours after glueing, there are still several large wrinkles that simply would NOT come out ""no matter what"" that are the result of the map constantly trying to re-roll itself. Since this photo was taken, I've also had to tape down the edges all around because it was beginning to peel itself away from the backing.

All in all, a good learning experience for the planned larger project, and a good map for general use as long as you're prepared for both the thinness and its annoying habit of always trying to re-roll itself.",4
Good size and can be used with erasable markers,4
Good quality and size,4
"Good size wall map with lots of details. I laminated over the lamination because the lamination was more like a gloss than a lamination and I intend to use wet erase markers on it. Still thought a larger map would me nice to see the small countries better, but was limited by my space for it. If I had it to do over again I wouldn't have bothered paying extra for the laminated version of this map. I would have gotten the regular map and laminated it at Kinkos,",4
Wanted to show my visiting friend from overseas just how big the world is compared to their country. This was a very helpful aid. Excellent quality and size.,4
Helpful.,4
not thick enough. but works,4
"I love maps, bought this to plan out my future travels. I'm hoping to go to Anguilla for a month's vacation, or maybe two but couldn't find it on the map,lol. So this big map is missing one location. The shipping was not the best, it had a crease right down the center of the map. It should have been put in a cardboard/PVC sleeve for safe shipping. All in all i give it 4 Stars.",4
Great graphics.,4
"LOVED this colorful map.  Wish the laminate was a little better quality..but since it will be put on cork or board to use the pins in, it will do. BUT LOVE the map otherwise.",4
"Laminated it to last. It's really helped our 4 year old with his counting. Flash cards only go up so high for preschoolers. We have him counting the days he's been in preschool. The repetition, and visuals are great!",4
"A teacher's day is long and there is a lot of paper coming in and going out. I picked this up out of desperation, frankly. So glad I did.

I have two folders for each class - work that needs to be graded and work for missing students. When a kid is absent, I take the work and put it in the MIA folder. When I collect work to be graded, it goes in the appropriate 'to be graded' folder. When I am leaving for duty or prep (someone uses my room during prep), I can grab the folders and have the work I need to grade.

The material is heavy duty ripstop nylon and I hold it to an unused blackboard using 3M heavy duty hangers. It's working aces.",4
"This thing is attached to my wall with thumb tacks and is currently holding an insane amount of paper, magazines, and books. It is very sturdy!. It does bow out if you overfill it as I have done, but it is still holding up. I am very happy with this purchase!",4
"I needed something to organize random papers that always seem to find their way into my office! It is not the most attractive organizer (might use it in my classroom instead), but it hangs nicely and holds all those extra papers that clutter up my office!",4
"I love this thing. I docked it a star because it doesn't come with it's own hooks or folders. I just use 3m hooks and got my own folders. It's a plasticy type of material but that's ok. It's perfect to store my business in/out, paid/unpaid, etc receipts.",4
"I am sure this would work wonderfully for teachers but I have used it within my home to organize mail, paper, and bills.  Most of the pockets are pretty deep.  The top pocket is not so it is a good place to store receipts for filing.  For most of the pockets, I use folders in order to easily remove all the papers associated with the pocket in one easy movement.  I pin the unit on the back of a door so it doesn't take up primary wall space.  I really like it and would recommend it to those who have a lot of paper that they need to process.",4
"I bought this item for my students and it is really very helpful. I put the students folders that they need to take home daily and their work, so it works as mail between us teachers and parents. The only thing is the after 3 days one pocket tore off for no apparent reason. But I still like it a lot and I think it helped us see who is missing what.",4
Huge panda! Kids love dressing it!,4
"This takes care of the ""What time is _________?"" question.  I wish there were more pre-printed tags with the set.  I've made a few extras so I'm not constantly changing the times for different schedules on different days.",4
"I have an extremely detailed schedule and this would be perfect if it had about four more slots for more time cards. Since it doesn't, hence the 4 stars and not five.",4
This chart was just what I needed for an area in my classroom.  It worked great at holding students name cards in place.,4
Works great!!  Exactly what it said.,4
Just as expected. Needed a visual schedule and this does the trick.,4
"My kids are pre-K. I ended up laminating the cards and turning them over. I simply wrote things that we do. Ie. ""Opening"" ""Discussion"" ""Lunch"" ""Lego Building"" ""Music"" ""Snack"" ""Park"" ... I remind my toddlers about things that are coming up and check off items as we complete them. They enjoy knowing what's going to happen-- and I enjoy knowing that I've completed everything.

The only downside for me is hanging it in my home. It's not the most aesthetic home addition.... I hang it from a tension rod and use those link clips in the holes. Then I take it down at the end of the day.. or whenever we have company.",4
"Just what I needed to teach my students place value during daily calendar. I took off a star because you have to cut out the numbers, and it doesn't come with rubber bands to wrap up the 10 bundles.",4
This is a good quality product. I took one star off simply because the plastic across the front tends to bend out when I put cards in it and this makes it difficult to read at times. If you are using sentence strips or something not much taller than the clear plastic it should work fine.,4
"I find that the ""pockets"" are not as deep as I would like them to be.  I have an older Carson Dellosa on that I like better.  But it does work and is durable and will last a long time.",4
Another good visual aid.,4
good,4
"Although, yes, the material is cheap (I think it is reasonably priced) the functionality of it still allows for variety of organization.

My recommendation is to get darker colored nail tacks from Orchard Supply and this way the Organizer stays flush with the wall rather than sagging. If you hate putting holes in the wall, the sticky adhesive may do the trick but not as wall as the nail tacks)

Great for all sorts of things, I put in clipboards and it helps me clear my desk. I also ordered more of these because its another way to store colored paper.

I am grateful they had these in black because it goes better with all the colors and design clipboard I put in.

Thanks for making these! I wish they had them when I was in school but am loving them now.",4
"The build quality of the hanging file is pretty good. I can tell the material is durable and holds together well. The pockets have adequate room for most uses, but standard pieces of paper will bow over top heavy over time unless you lay them on their side (long ways). There are three holes in the top of the folder which provides hanging options and the holes are reinforced with metal - nice touch there.

Con: some folds remained in the item due to being folded during shipping. Hopefully, these fold creases will disappear after the item hangs for a while.",4
Use it in my home office to hold various documents.  Seems to be built sturdy and holds folders well.,4
So much better than the blue pocket charts!!,4
This is a nice Dictionary for a child who nave has to carry it anywhere. It must weigh 5 pounds! It's pretty good though and will stay on the shelf unless it's needed.,4
"This is a good, basic plan book for elementary teachers. I bought several and have used them for the past two years. I'd like better paper quality and a few changes in format, but overall it's pretty good for the price.",4
"I'm not a teacher but i needed this to organize my plans and it works well for my needs. It's about 1/2 inch thick which I wasn't expecting, but I'm glad I got it.",4
"Smaller than I expected, but great quality.",4
"A little about me: I love narrow rule. I love good paper that lets me write with gel pen and doesn't ghost a lot. I am constantly on the look out for a journal which has both of those, and also does not have dark lines that contrast a lot with the page. It's a lot to ask, I know. ;)

I LOVE this journal. Quality paper, and the narrow rule lines are printed well. The ink color is perfect -- a comforting gray which doesn't jump off the page at you. :) Also, the cover is buttery soft! It's a pleasure to hold. Oh, and it lays flat pretty easily.

My only complaint is that the label and cord make an imprint on the cover, probably because each is also wrapped in clear plastic. I have unwrapped the ones I intend to use as gifts in the hopes that the marks will fade. For me, I don't really care, because the insides are so nice.",4
"I purchased originally purchased this journal on Amazon for the purposes of keeping in my vehicle glove box as a service record. Due to its size and the elastic closure I thought it would be perfect for that, but once it arrived and I discovered how beautiful and well made it was there was absolutely no way I could fathom using it for that purpose and have adopted it as my 2016 personal journal.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Softcover-Writing-Notebook-Table-of-Contents-185-Numbered-Pages-Archival-Stickers-Premium-Ruled-Paper-5-75-34-x-8-25-34-Expandable-Interior-Pocket-Bookmark-Perfect-Bible-Journal-or-Diary/dp/0692499555/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Softcover Writing Notebook: Table of Contents, 185 Numbered Pages, Archival Stickers, Premium Ruled Paper 5.75"" x 8.25"", Expandable Interior Pocket, Bookmark.

 Although I do point out in my review summary at the bottom of this page that the journal makes a faith-based charitable contribution per journal sold, and the product description itself is forthcoming in disclosing this, It may be noteworthy to add that the journal itself contains religious references. I, myself, am not a person of faith and I do recall being a bit disappointed with this aspect of the journal, especially since the religious references are located on the inside cover(s), and as such are not  pages one would necessarily consider removable.

This is simply an exquisite journal. The solid black slightly textured cover is gorgeous and so soft, it feels wonderful in your hands. The pages are of such high quality and absolutely do lay flat for journaling just as the seller indicates. The seller's pictures, while accurate, just do not do this journal justice. It has far exceeded my expectations.

"As described, Fast shipment. thank you",4
"I was initially drawn to the i>clicker Android app because it meant one less thing I had to carry around with me. I needed it for a few classes since it was part of my participation grade.

Unfortunately, that app was godawful. I ended up getting the actual remote. It's pretty basic, so I find it hard to believe that it's really worth the price. The cost might simply be reflective of the fact that i>clicker basically have a monopoly on this sort of thing. Still, after registration, it worked. I got through my classes and it never failed me.

I am not letting the app color my review of the remote. The remote itself works great. It's just the price of the clicker that seems outlandish to me, but at least it has a fairly decent resale value, and to their credit, i>clicker makes that process very easy.

(3.5/5 stars)",4
"i increased my stars from 1 to 3, because even though size mattered to me (a lot because the friend they were purchased for only wants cards she can put 4x6 pictures in), the cards are very pretty, i didn't give them to the friend they were originally purchased for.  hopefully they have corrected the size error on the page where you order them.

10/10/14 update: i'm now changing my review from 3 stars to 4, with the emphasis that the actual cards are less than 4x6, and the envelopes are also less than 4x6.  the dimensions of the cards should be stated clearly in the descriptions and not just the dimension of of the box they come in.  having said that, the box they come in being 6 inches should have told me that the cards would HAVE to be less than six inches.  i didn't notice that the height was almost an inch, which meant they were describing the box and not the cards in it.",4
"As the previous reviewer mentioned, these are very tiny notes!  The four smaller pads are the size of Post-Its that can really only be used as page markers or to write brief notes.  That being said, they are super cute and stick pretty well.  Great for francophiles!",4
Smaller than expected but great for a cozy kitchen. The design is even cuter in person and the cards are lovely.,4
"I really like the set up of this binder, however, you honestly COULD make your own at home.  The organizing tabs and pockets are actually really nice though.  If I could change anything, I would personally make it a bit smaller.",4
"GOOD:
 - Beautifully done, inside and out
 - Dividers and pocket sections.
 - Standard (8 1/2 X 11) sizing with standard holes (easy to save recipes from your printer)

WISH IT HAD:
 - D-Ring type binder (easier to keep papers straight and tends to put less stress on the rings over time)
 - Clear plastic sleeves for recipe cards (so you can see both sides when cooking)

Overall a very nice looking binder; as nice as any I have.",4
"My husband and I typically print out recipes from websites. This is a nice way to organize them into a binder.  I agree with another reviewer it would be nice to come with labels from which to choose but disagree about the sheet protectors should be provided. Although I use them, it might raise cost, and then people might complain about not wanting them. The price is good at $20. You can always buy your own sheet protectors.  I do think the binder has typical categories, but would be nice to create your own.  The binder itself has wonderful prints. You will enjoy the prints if you like William Morris of course.  If you are not as familiar with his work, the prints are from pre 20th century decorative arts. They were in arts and crafts style houses.  Not everyone is a print person, but I think these are not too ""busy."" I agree with another reviewer that binder is bigger than expected, but unlike them I see it as a benefit.  It is easier to prop up and I can use standardized paper and sheet protectors. Good product for a good price.",4
"This William Morris design binder would make an excellent gift for a wedding shower, a house-warming party, a newly-adult child about to embark on independent living, or just for passing down family recipes.  It holds approximately 120 recipes in a loose-leaf binder with pocket dividers into which you can tuck index card-size recipes.  The binder contains pre-printed, two-sided recipe sheets for handwriting recipes, and it uses the pocketed dividers as tabs labeling the major kinds of dishes -- everything but appetizers.  The problem, of course, is that in today's high-tech society, we want to print or scan recipes, not go through the laborious process of writing them down by hand.  Because the William Morris exterior harkens back to Victorian days, it seems perfectly appropriate to hand-write everything -- it's just that the average contemporary cook is not likely to want to take the time.  I found myself printing recipes, punching holes in them, and inserting them into the binder.

Hand-written recipes are a dying art, and they make excellent gifts for anyone who appreciates that kind of old-fashioned effort.  For the serious cook, however, this binder will fill up fast, and the sections will seem inadequate.

-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4
"A few years ago I organized my collection of recipes (handwritten, printouts, clippings, cards etc.) into binders.  Three binders.  My favorite is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homemade-Recipes-Tabbed-Recipe-Binder/dp/1605532975/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homemade Recipes Tabbed Recipe Binder</a>&nbsp;in the bigger size (it came in a small square size and a bigger 11.5 inch square size). All the larger recipe binders came with dividers and also with sheet protectors that would hold various sized recipes.  I supplemented these with lots of extra sheet protecors.  All those binders were 2.25 inches wide.

I expected this binder to be similar to the others but it is different.  Mainly, it is only 1.75 inches thick and it is not quite square, being 11 inches by 11.5.  It holds a lot less sheets.  Also, it provides stationery for printing recipes which I simply won't use.  Sheet protectors will work fine, you just will not fit as many in.

The binder and the section dividers which have pockets are very attractive.  I do wish the dividers were not pre-printers with section titles.  Their choice of titles is all wrong for me and I wish they were blank.

I give this 4 stars because it is well made and very attractive.  I have always loved Liberty Prints.  I will use this, just not exactly as designed.",4
The first thing I love about this recipe organizer is the stylish cover and classic look.  I have so many scraps of paper and misc recipe cards that I keep tucked into other recipe books and now I have a go-to book that holds these items with pocket dividers.  I also like the flexibility of being able to use a 3 hole punch to add in printed recipes or write in my own recipes on the pages provided.  I can't wait to pass along my book of beloved recipes to my children and their families.,4
"This recipe binder is beautifully colored and vintage looking in floral style on both the covers and the included pocketed recipe dividers (great for storing handwritten recipes from relatives). The binder is very sturdy as are the metal binder rings, which are easy to open and close, so you don't need to worry about the pages falling out. On the front inside cover there is a very helpful liquid and dry measurement conversion chart as well as a food equivalent chart - this is very handy and saves me from having to stop in the middle of cooking and looking up the conversions online. The back inside cover has a roasting temperature chart and a oven temperature chart, which I use less often but is also helpful.

As much as I love the binder itself and the vibrant and sturdy recipe dividers, I am disappointed with two things. One is that the prelabeled recipe dividers have categories that I don't use so I have recipes that don't fit under any of the given categories. For example, it has a Fruit and Vegetable and also a Beverages divider, but I won't use these. I wish these had been replaced with Appetizers and Casseroles/Slow Cooker categories. To remedy this issue, I have just whited out the categories I don't use on the divider tabs and written in ones that I do use. Unfortunately, this doesn't look too pretty on some of the dividers. I wish they'd have let you customize/write in your own categories instead.

 The other issue with this binder is the recipe sheets. They are very plain and look very cheap like a sheet of computer paper. They do allow you to fit 3 recipes each sheet between the front and back and it is nice that you can go to the website (galison.com) to reprint more sheets as needed, but the quality of these sheets doesn't match the quality of the binder. I plan on tossing these sheets out and getting more attractive and colorful 8.5 x 11"" recipe sheets.

But overall, this is a great recipe binder and organizer for all those treasured family recipes!",4
"Wow, I felt like a new bride when I opened this! (OK. Not exactly.) But what a great shower, wedding or housewarming idea: an attractive three-ring binder that contains pages for recipes, dividers with pockets, and handy measurement charts.

I transferred some of my favorite recipes to the pages, although others went right into the pockets because they were handwritten by now-deceased relatives and I didn't want to throw away my mementos.

So many of our stories are contained in what we eat: my family's lemon-cake pie recipe is not that hard to follow, resulting in a slightly tangy lemon custard resting on a flaky light layer of cake. Delicious! And it was served at the wedding reception of my great-grandparents in 1892. Or the even older Christmas steamed pudding recipe, which had to be re-constructed because the original cooks didn't write anything down. And every Valentine's day, I make strawberry-custard tarts for my husband, using a recipe my mom clipped from the Chicago Tribune in 1957.

This binder is a great way to preserve these heirloom recipes.

I would, though, add several extra blank pages. There are tabbed pages, but not enough. It would be helpful to include a few more of these so that categories like ""appetizers"" can be included.

I tweaked this product a bit by punching holes in sheets of construction paper to make extra sections.

Buy this for yourself or someone else: prepare to have fun, and work up an appetite!",4
"This recipe organizer consists of a sturdy 11 by 11  by 1 -inch three-ring binder with eight tab dividers denoting recipe categories such as ""desserts"" (each of which has a back pocket for loose papers). Within each section are five sheets of glossy paper that are preprinted with lines for writing out recipes by hand, one imagines in a perfect copperplate. You can print more sheets from the product listing on the publisher's website, on whatever quality of paper your home printer holds and, if it's a color printer, with pale green lines like the original pages (though my inkjet interpreted the color as blue). However, if you are an enthusiastic cook this notebook may not be thick enough to hold your entire collection. The cover of the binder, and the heavy paper composing the dividers, are each printed with a different William Morris textile or wallpaper pattern rendered in mint green, pale blue, peach, and pink. The inside covers of the binder are printed with charts for imperial to metric conversion of a few measurements, ""food equivalents"" such as how many tablespoons are in a stick of butter, a chart of roasting times for various meats, and a chart of oven temperature equivalents (although most recipes give you precise temperatures in degrees, rather than merely telling you to use a ""moderate"" or ""hot"" oven). If you have any basic cookbooks these charts will be redundant. This is a good wedding or birthday gift for any recipient who loves Victorian-ish decorating magazines that specialize in frilly pastels and an abundance of knickknacks, and imply their readers are constantly relaxing with delicate china cups of tea.",4
cute,4
So far the reading has been interesting. It is a subject you hear people talking about and it was somthing I wanted to know more about. Todate I've found the subject to be as interesting as suspected and the author makes it easy to understand. I recommend this book.,4
"I enjoy the philosophy behind this book, wish it had a few more symbols described but it does empower the reader to discern the symbolism of dreams even if it is not in the book, I would recommend to anyone interested in the meaning behind dreams.",4

This is my favorite calendar.  I get one every year.,4
"There tactile letters were exactly what I was looking for. Great for those that do a version of Montessori at home. They fit the bill and are at least $10 cheaper than what you can find elsewhere. Also, I rarely see packs with both the upper and lower case letters. A great value and a fun way to practice pre-writing skills with young children.",4
"I was buying supplies to help out a teacher. They asked for stickers. I said what kind? They listed off a bunch of examples and this book covered most of that list. The teacher was thrilled with it. So there you go, teacher approved.",4
"These stickers are very nice, but very teacher like.  I bought them to use with a calendar and they work well for that because of the sizes and everything, but they're just not very pretty.  They are utilitarian.  I do like them though and I would consider buying again if I couldn't find something prettier.",4
I love the book so far but how can you possibly see any of the graphs which so far are many. I have blown up my text to the largest size but I still can no see them. They apprear to have great info in them...,4
"I am not a homeschooling parent, yet have purchased a number of homeschooling books and resources to augment the development of my children and to build an agenda of activities that is more sophisticated (intellectually) than the commercial tools provide.

abbey road album is much better per my opinion.,4
"It was good but not as good as the vinyl copy
Knowing how the original tape master sounds the CD is a far cry away",4
Its more decorative than a vinyl to actually be listened to. I bought this as a present for a friend who is obsessed with the beatles and has her entire room decked out. She loved it and literally teared up. I think its a success for anyone who wants to own a nice novelty vinyl.,4
sounds great,4
"The bell bottoms were hideous, and so were the clogs with mini skirts we couldn't sit in. I would never ware those fashions again but the music is still good and the beatles were a part of everything.",4
"Music is (as always) great! And since I own every Beatles' LP (vinyl), and I just ripped the remastered discs to my iTunes library, I'm giving 4-stars to what I would normally give 1-star, even though these reviews are for the item, not just the music, and the item is really flawed:

For gods' sake, why are the discs in slots so small??? This applies to every remastered Beatles disc I bought from Amazon:
White, SgtPepper,Revolver,PleasePleaseMe,RubberSoul,MagicalMystery,withtheBeatles,HardDay's,AbbeyRoad... but it's really difficult to get the damned discs out of the White Album!
RIDICULOUS!",4
"When will someone acknowledge that the enormous popularity of the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was as much a consequence of opportunity  and demographics as it was musical artistry. The year was 1968  and tens of millions of Baby Boomers (now outnumbering their parents and  grand parents) were teenagers with spending money in their pockets.  Teenagers had been buying rock'n'roll records since Bill Haley and the  Comets released `Rock Around The Clock.' But the 60's decade was different:  never before had there been so many kids with so much cash (economists call  it `disposable income'). Teenagers bought fast cars, fast food and millions  of those black vinyl things.
The one commonality of all Baby Boomers was  the War in Vietnam. Teenagers were either waiting to go to Vietnam, in  Vietnam, coming home from Vietnam (perhaps), or doing their damnedest to  stay out of Vietnam. The War was an American invention, and so was  rock'n'roll. Teenagers denounced everything institutional and embraced  anything foreign. The British Invasion, led by the Beatles, was scarcely an  invasion at all: it was a welcoming party given by the Baby Boomers. The  Beatles were at the right place at the right time. Sure Sgt. Pepper was the  art album of the decade, but more importantly it was the Great Escape. One  could understand the assignation of President Kennedy `With A Little Help  From My Friends.' `When I'm Sixty-Four' was an optimistic ditty if your  draft number was 1,000 and they had just called 999. `A Day In The Life'  was an ideal way to reflect on America's greatest (and dead) civil rights  leader - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. If you were unfortunate enough to have  suffered the Tet Offensive, `Lovely Rita' (your girl back in the world) was  the only thing that kept you going. And lastly, `Good Morning Good Morning'  was a sardonic greeting shouted by police during the Democratic National  Convention in Chicago. Sgt. Pepper defined a generation? Nonsense. The  generation defined Sgt. Pepper.",4
I bought this as a science resource for homeschool. It is not a complete resource. It is a great supplement if you have other tools but just not to be confused with a full resource tool for this grade level.,4
"This is a very nicely-sized calendar, the pages are large, with medium-sized day boxes, not quite large enough for me. But, if you want to jot a few brief notes, the boxes will be adequate. All public holidays are well-marked, and  the day page is a soothing on the eye beige-type color. The prints and etchings surrounding the edges of the pages are very evocative of the Edwardian, and even the Victorian period. There is not much Art Deco to be seen here., although Downton certainly approaches that period.

The pages and the pictures for each month are enormous. The pictures of each month do not necessarily reflect the month shown,  and are lacking in explanations of the scene being shown. Of course if you are a Downton fan, you will very well know what each picture represents., but others, who buy the calendar to evoke a certain period in time, and a way of life that is long gone, might appreciative a few informative sentences explaining the happenings represented on each month's picture.

The photography is glorious. The paper stock used, is of high-quality, and each calendar page itself is very cute, and very quaint, this is not a grand calendar, in the Downton tradition, this imparts more of a cozy feeling, and it would definitely have been displayed downstairs, and not upstairs at Downton itself.

So, it is a bit confusing, the grand, very grand annd imposing picture of Downtom on the calendar cover, the very cute, and  the very well-chosen patterns, colors and arrangements of the calendar pages themselves. But, the photographs for each month are really not that exciting, indeed are a bit lackluster when  considering all of the drama and excitement that could have been represented in the pictures, and there really should be some text added to explain the occurrences in the pictures to non-Downton  fans.

So, a nice calendar of good quality, well-worth the price, but a bit let down by the less than exciting pictures on each day of the month. A Downton fan will love it, others, maybe not.

The price is surprisingly moderate, considering the run-away best seller that is the series, the quality is high, and it will look particularly nice hung  in a homey or old-fashioned kitchen. I just really wish that the monthly  photographs.had been more representative of the high-drama, and massive tragedy that has enticed much  of the world to the compulsive viewing, reviewing, and re-reviewing of this lovely soap opera.",4
"I only started watching Downton Abbey last year and it has quickly become my favorite show. I love Downton memorabilia and just recently saw this wall calendar and knew I had to have it.  Incidentally enough, I still didn't own a 2016 wall calendar, so it was truly meant to be.

The calendar is a standard size calendar with high quality photographs.  The colors and images are beautiful, but like the majority of reviewers have stated, the selection of photos could have been better.  For instance, this month, I have a lone shot of Cora, whom I adore, but would have much rather had a group picture of the family or the serving staff and perhaps a couple of the estate. I love the cover picture and wish there were more shots like that.

If you're a fan, you won't mind the choice of photos for each month.  And for the current price, you're getting a great deal.",4
I like this calendar but the only thing I didn't think of when I purchased was being able to write on it because its in black. Otherwise very nice,4
"This is super nice and very big. My only concern is that it is quite hard to follow roads on this map. I purchased this map to aid in a future road trip, and following the roads on this map is difficult. However, it is nice that it has some topographical information on it.",4
Very small print but I'm not disappointed. Good quality materials.,4
NOT LAMINATED!! Multiple reviews state that this map is laminated but it is NOT laminated. Otherwise it is a great and very detailed map.,4
"The colors are excellent and there are a good amount of cities listed.  I'm using it on a wall in my den to glance at if someone mentions where they live.  I'm only giving a star off because the lamination is so thin. However, maybe that's good because so far I just have it stuck up with scotch tape.",4
"The map wasn't laminated as firmly as I expected or would have liked, but nontheless is a great map to put on a wall. One of my favorite world maps.",4
great for topography. some stronger contrast of colors among states would be okay,4
"I wanted a map to frame and hang in my living room. I like being able to reference places on the news as well as having a reference for conversations that involve traveling. (For some reason I have those conversations a lot.) But I also wanted something that DIDN'T look like it belongs in a 5th-grade social studies classroom. This map is perfect for that. It's very pleasing to the eye and feels more like a ""grown up"" map than most of the ones I've seen that use different solid colors to separate the states. It's also very nice to have the bordering parts of Canada and Mexico visible.

The level of detail is very nice. I've lived in a few very small towns and most of them are actually listed on this map! The font choice is excellent as well.

I will agree with another reviewer who said that it's somewhat difficult to find or follow the names of mountain ranges. That's really my only knock against it. To be fair though, there's only so much room, and I personally care more about being able to read the roads, towns, lakes and state names than the mountain ranges.",4
"Awesome purchase, but the size is overwelming and definately not cheap if you plan on framing it. The color and print on it is great and legible.",4
"Once again, National Geographic did not disappointment me.  This map is so cool!  I love the detail and coloring.  I really like the fact that NG did not make the ocean and seas blue.  Definitely Executive Style!",4
good,4
"Once again, National Geographic did not disappointment me.  This map is so cool!  I love the detail and coloring.  I really like the fact that NG did not make the ocean and seas blue.  Definitely Executive Style!",4
"Great map in very stylish colors from NG. The only reason I give it 4 out 5 is that laminating plastic is little bit thin so when I stick it nails, it tore further up so I had to keep it tension free.",4
Got it for the grandkids. They need a world view. This provides it at a reasonable price.,4
I mounted this map on a cork board in my HAM shack and find it adequate for my needs but the lamination causes unwanted reflections when it is viewed from any distance that is not 90 degrees  perpendicular to the face of the map.,4
It is...What it is,4
"very big, nice contrast on the colors for look and viewability.  Very large, nice laminatin, best map deal around by 5 fold.",4
"Came on time and looked as expected, It will be a gift so I will be waiting to see how much the receiver likes it.",4
LIttle more data than I really wanted but was shipped in hard plastic tube and well protected.,4
"I'm a biology professor, and I teach microscopy. There are experiments in this book that I didn't even know about. My nephew and I are gonna have soooo much fun. I can't wait to share this with him and work with his new microscope. This is waaaay better than buying kids pointless games. Learning is food for the brain and it's better to start them while they're young.",4
"Purchased because it was pretty and because I lost my old one I'd had forever. My old one had spiral binding and I much prefer that, but this one was so pretty..... we'll see how long it lasts.",4
I should  have looked at the size...it's a bit small for all the information I was needing to record....but it is okay - nice - product is made good and the service of getting it was great -,4
good,4
"reading a lot about Alaska, fiction and nonfiction, lot of history; map book very useful",4
"The sheer size of Alaska tends to defeat what would otherwise be an unbeatable map collection for most states in the lower 48.  A second challenge is the very thin transportation infrastructure in Alaska; huge areas of the state are not on the limited road network and can be reached in a timely manner only by air.  Enormous swaths of wilderness have no transportation network at all.

The DeLorme ""Alaska Atlas and Gazetteer"" is an excellent resource for trip planning.  Used in conjunction with the most recent ""Milepost"", the average travelor can reach any point in the state accessible by road and plan entry into many other areas.  However, the scale of the maps is insufficient for detailed off-road route planning; deep country hikers, hunters, and fishermen are advised to seek more specialized map products.

This Atlas is highly recommended to the traveler in Alaska looking for a compact map resource. It is also a good starting point for planning trips in determining where more detailed map products will be needed.",4
"Short and to the point, makes perspective easy to understand and lots of images to help you understand and whatnot.",4
"I got this for my grandson who has to read for 20 minutes a day, as required by his teacher. This is perfect for him as the timer lets him keep track of the time and ensures he will read the entire 20 minutes. However, it is a little bulky for children's books, making it hard for him to use as a bookmark.",4
Works OK but a little hevay for in the books.,4
This item is so nifty.  It's perfect for counting down those 20 minutes of daily reading.,4
I got this for part of a birthday present for a young reader that had to read for so many minutes per night as part of his homework.  His mom thought it was a hit because it marked his place and he could set his own timer.,4
"I bought one for my son who loves to read. This one is not as easy to lose as a regular bookmark. It uses an LR1130 button battery. You will need a watch screw driver to open the compartment. It beeps when the time is up. You can set it up as a countdown, count up or cumulative (adds up the time every time you pause and start again). It also is a regular digital clock when timer is not being used. Bubble wrapped. Made in China.

Setting the clock for the first time:
-Press and hold Mode button until all 4 digits blink.
-Press Hrs and Mins to correct time
-Press Mode once to set

Sorry there is no alarm clock function.  Alarm (or I should say, beeps) is only for the countdown timer.

Pros:
- Fun
- Cute

Cons:
- Do not lose the instruction. Setting the clock, or setting the timer may be tricky if you forget how to do it.
- Top heavy and thicker than a regular bookmark
- On setting up the timer, once you make an error by putting a wrong time (if you want 30 minutes but somehow you pressed the hour button), you cannot go backward unless you reset. To reset, you hold the Hour and Min button at the same time for a couple of seconds. Then the timer will go back to zero. Dont worry, it will not reset the clock, just the timer.",4
"Original Review:  The price was right -- half as much as the lab notebook sold at the school bookstore, but this one is perforated so that the pull-out is the original. It's supposed to be the copy. I have to manually cut out the teacher's copy. The teacher laughed and said, ""that's what happens when you try to go cheap.""

Revised Review:  Whoops!  It didn't know that there were actually too versions of the item. I should have ordered the one with the copy perforated for pullout.  It was a very good deal compared to the price at my college.",4
easy to install.  A little extra work to find the correct pages when you do not have the aligned edition.,4
good,4
These will be very helpful to find the main subjects in my Catechism. My book is the one with a tan cover with orange lettering. Contains 26 tabs which I find easy to install. Even the page numbers referenced in the instructions matched my version of the Catechism book.,4
A little goes a long way with this product. It will last you forever. It has a great smell and left my hair feeling silky. Reduced the amount of frizz and looked great after flat ironing it.,4
"I have been using jojoba oil for some time now and I have purchased from several companies. I really like using jojoba oil especially when I do my at-home chemical peels, it is the perfect product to soothe my skin afterwards.

As far as this particular brand, I would rate them in the top 3 that I have tried. the absorption rate is terrific and it is an added plus that it is certified organic! That is especially good for those who make creams, butters, oils etc...

For the price, you are getting a healthy amount of oil too. I would recommend this product easily.

Instanatural provided this oil for my review and feedback.",4
Gifted to grandchild.,4
"good quality and printing, nicely packaged and fast shipping. recommended for quality correspondence.",4
Cards are kind of small but they look good and the quality is good for the money.,4
"I received these Thank You cards at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, these are really plain, but still nice. They arrived on time and in a nice clear, solid package so they didn't get bent or ripped on their way to me. There were 12 Thank You cards, blank inside, made out of a premium grade linen cardstock. I was very impressed with the high grade of cardstock used to make these cards and the envelopes were quality made as well, they had a peel off tab to seal them shut. They also came with a Thank You card from the company giving me a discount on future orders. Personally, I think they are pretty plain, but sometimes there is a need for a very plain card. Overall, I liked them.",4
"Love the leather.  Love the cotton pages.  It was just a little smaller than I expected.  I have made a few handmade books in my time, and this really seems to be handmade, which adds to its likability though I'm a little afraid of the folios coming loose with how this was bound.",4
"Good binding for the gatherings, great cloth paper, great leather. It's a little small, but I still filled one up before moving on to a larger version.",4
"Very beautifully made and sturdier than I thought it was going to be. I should have paid more attention to the A6, but that was more my fault than theirs. I am using it as an art journal. I was hoping to use it more as a journal though. Very good quality.",4
"This planner is useful for those wishing to boost their productivity.  The most difficult part is sticking to using the planner itself.  I'm not big on inspirational quotes though, and the planner is full of them.  I could use the wasted space for notes, lists, etc.  And indeed, I sometime use white-out to cover the quotes and use the space anyway.  Another issue is that it only has five days per week.  This works well most people I assume because a lot of these planners use this type of method, but it frustrates me to no end.  As a student with a full-time job, I need to be productive seven days a week!",4
"More than a coloring book, this one contains mazes and projects as well.  The pages are kind of wild and tend toward what I'd call the 60's effect.  The book itself is nicely made and the pictures are well done.  If you are into these types of coloring books you will probably enjoy this one.",4
"This is an enjoyable entry into the world of adult coloring . There is a useful full color tutorial  with basic information about color and pencil techniques and a full color double page  example . May of the drawings have tiny little patterns  that can get you into a kind of trance state . Some designs are busy others have room for  improvisation . Most designs  are of animals and plants  with an intense level of fanciful decorative detail  giving great potential for almost psychedelic results. On the other hand some of the designs are simpler  and rather than staying within the lines  we chose to allow the lines to define the form but not to force a multiplicity of shading and color.  O.K .  what that means is  we colored the whole deer brown  instead of going for the festive  fantasy look.  this was fun for us  ( several family members tried the book out. Tihw mage on the cover is fairly typical of the art style  so if  this style attracts you, you will probably enjoy coloring  this book.",4
"I love these ""adult"" coloring books. I've always loved coloring, even with my kids when they were young and now with my grandkids. These adult coloring books have so much detail and depth to them. The pictures in this particular book are mostly animals. Coloring is very relaxing to me. And with these detailed pictures, it really takes your mind off of the problems even for a bit. You are never too old to color!",4
"My first impression of this coloring book was what a nice heavy duty quality the cover is and the size of the book, in dimensions.  I was very excited to try this book out, I have used others in the past and still haven't found the coloring book I just LOVE.  I used two different types of markers on the first title page to see if they would bleed through.  They bled through.  So I need to purchase some colored pencils and try this book again.  Otherwise, it is a nice book.  The coloring pages are beautiful, there is a nice variety of pictures and they are good size.  If anyone can recommend some good colored pencils to use for this, I am searching amazon now.",4
"I have mixed feelings about this set.  While I believe it is a good opportunity to try Derwent Colorsoft pencils if you haven't before, and the pictures in the coloring book are delightful, the set does have a few shortcomings.

Comparing the price of the  basic 12 pack of Derwent Colorsoft pencils here on Amazon to this set, it is apparent that the coloring book is a bit pricey.  Plus, this is a set of 10 pencils, without a nice solid tin box, so the coloring book becomes even pricier, doesn't it?

If you just color just for enjoyment, then you won't mind the fact that pages are printed on both sides.  If you color to create frame-able artwork, you will definitely mind that you can see the shadow of the black ink from the backside of your work shining through.....  And if you color both sides, you will soon find out that the paper weakens and tears when you try to color both sides in the same area.  You will have to choose which side to color--and I've found that it is sometimes a difficult choice to make!

Which brings me to a rave about some of these drawings:  Some are really special:  The squirrel on the tree trunk; the fox looking over his shoulder at a falling leaf;  lady bugs hidden in a mass of leaves; a stand of thistle pods, and many more.

I did enjoy trying the Derwent Colorsoft pencils:  They are truly soft, creamy, smooth, with rich and deep color.  Trying this small set prompted me to buy a larger set of Colorsoft, and I also picked up the Derwent set of metallic colors.  (Really nice!)  Regarding this set of ten that comes with this set:  I did not care for the simple folding ""box"" that the pencils came in.  It's more like a sleeve, and I needed to find something else to put them in.",4
"There is a lot I like about this coloring book.  It's printed on thick paper, and it comes with a set of colored pencils.  The pencils are some of the nicest I've ever tried.  They color like you are using paint in pencil form---thick, rich color.  I love the suggestions at the start of the book for coloring.  I am not an artist in any way, and I welcome any ideas for my coloring relaxation!  The nature theme of the book is a nice one, and there's some variety, like make your own mazes and hidden pictures.

The few things I don't like---the pages are printed on both sides, so if you do one you like on both sides, one side will be hidden when you display it.  The pages are printed close to the binding, and don't come out of the book easily.  I like to take a page out while I work on it, and a bit of the picture ripped as I did that several times.  The pictures are also a bit repetitive, with parts of big pictures being repeated in smaller form with other pictures on some pages.

Overall, though, this is quite a nice coloring book, and I will certainly chose the Derwent brand of colored pencils next time I buy some.",4
"The is a great adult coloring book for animal lovers. The images are pretty, varied, and lend themselves to colorful renditions. The Colorsoft Pencils work just great - ideal for shading. If you like them, you might want to purchase additional colors. (I also have had good luck with using watercolor pencils - a little water on a brush and you have great blending.) My main criteria for adult coloring images is that the drawings aren't ""sketched"" but that each item has complete boarders; this coloring book meets that specification.",4
"I have a few of these books. This one is my favorite. The pictures are beautiful and interesting, not too big or too small. Colored pencils would probably be ideal but I like using gel pens. I will probably go through my ink pretty quickly however. On a side note, the paper is thick enough that I can use gel ink and it doesnt ruin the pictures on the other side. I do find that these help my stress. I have a condition that aggravates my heart when Im stressed that is very noticeable. But if I take time to color in these I've noticed my symptoms have gone and I feel much more calm. And its way easier than meditating!",4
"<div id=""video-block-R1GL2LSUUNNZQP"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1R0UDnpwOS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ZD7vTqPKS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;This is a lovely coloring book depicting the wildlife of the British countryside as well as the surrounding flowers and plants.  It includes foxes, owls, stags, birds, cows, sheep, rabbits, squirrels and more. The designs are drawn with firm, dark outlines and are made extra fun to color with enlivening doodles throughout the animals.  There are a number of geometric, sort of wall paper designs and a few fun challenges (mazes, areas to color yourself, etc.) which makes the book a little bit of an activity book as well as a coloring book.

The designs in this book are printed on both sides of white medium weight, non-perforated paper. The binding is glued rather than sewn (which is unusual for a coloring book from the UK.) Many of the designs merge into the binding and some portion of them will be lost if you cut the pages from the book. I could not break the spine enough to get the book to lay flat.  This could be a problem with designs that merge into the binding.

Thirteen of the designs spread across two pages.  In my book, the pages were not aligned well.  It seems to be a printing issue rather than an alignment issue.  I found that the elements at the center of the each side of the binding doubled slightly.  That left me with a design that could not be aligned properly. This may be particular to my book or it may be a general issue.  I am thinking a more general issue as the images were sized a particular way rather than printed improperly on the page.

Because of this alignment issue, the problems with trying to get the book to lay flat, and because most coloring medium bled through the paper, I detracted a star from my rating.  The designs are absolutely five star but the execution of the printing and the paper had problems.  I still like my coloring book and will certainly color the single page designs.

I test all of my coloring books with a wide variety of coloring mediums.  I will list those at the bottom of this review.  This is what my test results were:

All alcohol-based markers bled through this paper easily.  The water-based markers either bled through or left a distinct color shadow at the back of the page.  My India ink artist pens also left a shadow at the back of the page.  My gel pens left a shadow of indistinct color on the back of the page.  All of my coloring pencils performed fantastic. The book is published by Derwent and is supposed to be especially good with Derwent Coloursoft pencils.  I found that Prismacolor Premier Soft Core and Faber-Castell Polychromos worked just as well on this paper.  My hard lead Prismacolor Verithins laid down nicely and did not leave a dent on the back of the page.

These are the coloring medium that I use for testing. If there is something else you feel I should be testing, please let me know and I will see if I can add it to my growing pile:

Markers: 1) alcohol-based  Copic Sketch, Prismacolor double ended markers (brush and fine point), Sharpies (fine and ultra-fine) Bic Mark-its (fine and ultra-fine) and 2) water-based  Tombows dual end markers (brush and fine point), Stabilo 88, and Staedler triplus fineliners

India Ink:  Faber-Castell PITT artist pens (brush tip)

Gel Pens:  Sakura, Fiskars, Uni-ball Signo in the following sizes - 0.28/0.38/0.5/1.0 and Tekwriter

Coloring Pencils:  Prismacolor Premier Soft Core, Derwent Colorsoft, Prismacolor Verithins, and Faber-Castell Polychromos",4
"This adult coloring book contains 89 single pages that you can color plus the inside covers could also be colored, though they have a different, shiner finish.  The drawings vary between intricate, geometrically patterned animal figures and designs and those that are less so, but all could be considered challenging enough to keep one occupied for many, many days.  The many, different patterns encourage you to create and experiment with your own individual color schemes and result in finished projects that are unique to each ""artist"".

I enjoyed the information, examples, and the tutorial in the front of the book.  I didn't so much care for the interactive pages of finishing your own drawings, mazes, or the object searches.  I believe that some of the searches are incorrect as I couldn't find all of the objects in the tadpole/frog search, and I looked and counted numerous times.  Fortunately, there aren't that many of these distractions, and you can color the page, finished or not.

The pages are all of a heavy white stock and are printed on both sides.  Most all of the drawings are made up of small spaces that are best colored with pencils.  I also purchased some sets of Prismacolor pencils when I ordered this book.  They work quite well but are expensive compared to standard brands of color pencils.  I am happy with both book and pencils but fight the thought that I'm ""wasting time"" while feeling rather unproductive coloring.  I do have a sense of satisfaction when I see the finished pictures, or even the colored individual parts, as it takes a lot of time to finish an entire page!

If you are creative and like drawings of plants, insects, and animals in nature, I think you would enjoy this book.  If you want simple drawings that you can color quickly with crayons, pencils, or markers, this probably isn't the book for you.  It is very well done but requires some skill and time commitment to finish the drawings.",4
"I've not done adult coloring books before but several on my friends do and it looks relaxing. I love animals and thought this would be a cool choice. There are a variety of animals. I think the deer were some of the coolest but I liked the birds too. The book has a nice intro with tips on achieving different looks in the way your color the pictures included.
There are many different areas to color and each page takes a long time to complete if you want to create a cool pattern.
This book will provide many many hours of coloring and provides a nice selection of scenes to engage you in a relaxing hobby.",4
"I have never lost my love to color, but am not artistic enough to draw or paint.  This is a grown-up way to enjoy that pastime and feel like you are doing something pretty.  I only dinged it a star for the price, as you can find different kinds of coloring books at Michael's for about $10.  The paper is good quality and the designs on opposite sides of the paper are compatible and different at the same time.  I'm learning how to shade, which I never did much of as a kid, and there are several youtube videos to help you do this better.",4
Nice journals.  Would recommend.  Have purchased multiple orders and never disappointed.,4
"Is it my imagination or companies becoming more and more demanding, not about a password itself, but THEIR determination of how many digits, how many letters(both CAPS and regular type), how many numbers. No wonder I am always changing my Facebook password. I just KNOW that there have been times when I have put in the correct password several times and when I put it in to change it they tell me that it was the previous password. Who can remember all these different passwords and not to forget that passwords are ""Case Sensitive,"" which just means that when you put in the 15 digit password, don't forget that the third T is a Capital T, because if you put a lower case ""t"" your password WILL be rejected and you will have to start all over again. So after seeing a couple of password books on Amazon, I decided to breakdown and get one. The first one was so big that I had nowhere to put it. I no longer use my laptop and always use the iPad, so I wanted something small enough to put on the table next to my chair. The next one I ordered was the size of a pad of deposit slips with cheap paper cover and four entries for each letter of the alphabet with X,Y and Z sharing four. Ridiculous! I found this one and looked at the dimensions and decided try try this one and kept my fingers crossed.

I got it right on the third try. It is a bit smaller than a paperback. There are a few pages in the front giving you tips on creating a password. There are almost 150 pages with 3 entry sections on each page and several pages in the back just for notes. There is a magnetized flap that keeps the book closed and room for a pen storage. This book has just what I was looking for and if it was sitting on a table it DOES NOT scream Password Keeper. There is only one thing wrong and the rest is so right that I will find a way to work it out, but I did take off one star because that might be very important for some people. There are no alphabetical sections. There is no tabs with letters on them and I really can't figure out why because there are plenty of pages separate into sections for each letter, so you will have to make the determination, what is the criteria most important to you. I do recommend it for all the other reasons.",4
"The covers are colorful and sturdy.  They fit perfectly in a pocket or bag for daily lists and reminders.  The lines on the pages are a bit dark (red) and very skinny.  Otherwise, perfect for personal use or to give as student gifts.",4
"These are small but colorful. They were the perfect size for ""care packages"" I was making. The girls thought they were fun journals.",4
I bought these for my cheerleading team to write goals and motivational things inside of them. They are a little small but other than that they are great. I am giving this a 4 star instead of 5 because the price is crazy high for how small these are,4
"Pretty good value. Some pages messed up / cut poorly, but okay.",4
"I like these because they are pocket sized and easy to carry with you. They are also quite durable. I would have rated them a 5 if the price was lower. I just think they are a bit overpriced. Still, they are perfect for my needs and the cover designs are cute.",4
"Cute little notebooks.  Only caution is that the writing lines are extremely narrow, so not really well designed for writing on the lines.  We use as order pads at a restaurant so the lines aren't entirely necessary.",4
Ok.,4
Really yummy and smells like they should. They have great pigment and I love the glitter. I bought this product twice and they lasted at least a few months. As  you can see the ink isn't too much but its worth the buy if you want to be different in your writing!,4
"Really cool and bright colors.  Mix of pink, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple with one of each, plus some had 2 of that color.

It states in the description that they smell, but mine don't have an odor.

Some colors are hard to see.

Need to give it awhile to dry so it doesn't smear.",4
"I like the pen and the ease of coloring with them, but the fragrance does not last long and some of the colors fade, making red look like frosted pink.",4
Good job,4
I was so excited to get these but they don't write that well and they don't smell hardly at all! I still use them in hopes that they will write better and maybe using them more they may smell more!!,4
"I bought these for a friends little girl, and I am going to buy me a set.  They're smooth, and the smell isn't overbearing.. I like them",4
I bought these at a book store and they were recommended by the sales person. I really enjoy these gel pens but wish the scent was stronger. I have a hard time picking it up but I like the way the gel pens write and color. I could have just gotten a bad box or maybe they were sitting on the shelf too long. The one that really stands out is the watermelon one and it smells great!,4
"Really love these pens for how smooth they write since its gel. If you write in journals, this is what I recommend to use for rainbow colors. I also like that they smell nice when your put your nose to them. My favorite is the pink scent ;). The yellow and light green sometimes doesn't  work well but mostly solid. A con would be the price for how fast they run out but still very beautiful colors",4
"I purchased these as a gift for my granddaughter.  She really likes them. The colors of the ink are very vibrant.  The yellow ink is a bit difficult to see.  However, maybe on a darker or black paper it too would be quite vibrant.",4
These are okay.  Don't last too long but for the price they are worth it.,4
"tween girls love these! combine with a journal or a book like ""coke or Pepsi?"", and it's a great birthday gift.",4
I love these pens ive bought three sets.  They smell good they write great they blend so cool from one color into another.  Ive used one pen for an entire page and the color changes turned out beautifully.  They just run out way to fast but I like them so much I'll keep buying them,4
"I love these! Everyone that sees them are jealous! I was not that impressed with the quality though. I mean they work, but sometimes it skips and I had one leak already. They are still fun to write with though!",4
"Smell is not very strong with most pens, but the colors are fun and different than most pens on the market.",4
"Fun to use... Colored in a pattern using all of these pens, but then started using up the ink, and was unable to continue with the color I wanted to use... Won't use these again for coloring, but like them for writing...",4
"As far as gel pens go, these are decent. The ink flows smoothly, never skips, and despite being scented, doesn't smell bad. But, they aren't spectacular. I would have been just as happy with a set of regular pastel gel pens. These ones write in just one color at a time, and when one uses enough ink to reach the point where the colors meet, the ink switches to an unpleasantly muddy color for a surprisingly long time before it completely changes to the next one.

I colored one stylized mandala design on 8.5x11 card stock using nothing but this pen, and the result was nice. I started in one corner and worked my way down and around. The design slowly changes shade as it goes down the page, and I receive a lot of compliments on that one. But I used up the started-as-blue pen, and now I don't have access to the blue ink until I use up at least one color in another pen.

So, when used up on one page, the pens can give nice results. Otherwise, the scent and changing colors are just a gimmick. I'm sure there is a very specific market for these. I am not part of it, and can't imagine anyone who would be. I'll eventually use them up as they are decent quality. But I can't imagine buying them again.",4
very lite ink.  hard to see.,4
3rd grade daughter LOVED these!,4
These are fun gel pens. Of course with these you always expect them to not write perfectly and have bubbles in between. But they are fun for kids that want to color on fuzzy posters.,4
"Cute, colorful. The ink flow ""skips"" quite often, so these pens are not very useful for practical writing/note-taking/etc. They're okay for doodling, though. The scents are alright; typical artificial-fruity scents, but not exactly fruity, either. I still like the smells.",4
In description it did not say they were pastel or multi colored. But they do have very nice strong scent that lasts on paper. You can see the darker colors on white paper.,4
"These are great colors, but a bit pricey.",4
These pens are pretty kool.  Has everything a child could want in a scented pen.  And they are child safe.,4
"My wife loves Dragons so I thought that she would love this calendar.  She has not seen it yet, but I found it a bit juvenile.  She won't and that is all that counts!",4
as expected,4
"Four star rating simply because the way the dvds are stacked in the case seam a bit awkward. If your in to suspens, action, gory filled movies; this is the series for you.",4
interesting read,4
i hope this book and pamphlets help me get through my business courses and help me under stand the concepts better the first time around,4
"Great reference tool (especially if you're have open book tests) Easy to use, most of the formulas you'll need are explained right there.",4
Okay...,4
Comprehensive.  Could be improved with some additional information such as calculator and/or spreadsheet commands.,4
"We liked these books for the most part. Having been born and raised in CA, I have learned all about these subjects, as have all of my older children. We thought that these books would be good for our younger children to read before we go back to visit, as we could visit some of the relevant sites with our younger children and expound on what they read about in these and other books. This is a nice addition to our other child friendly books on the subjects. We can use them as a springboard for further discussion and education.
Our daughters find them interesting and eagerly read them and asked questions that we could discuss. Just what one wants from educational books!",4
"These small format 32 page glossy booklets pack a lot of information into each volume. They are tagged as being suitable for grades 4-6 and for readers of lexile 630 to 740. I don't know anything about lexiles, but these books strike me as being more suitable for grades 3-5. I would hope 6th graders would be nearly ready for something a bit more advanced than these simple books. They are full color with lots of interesting graphics -- photographs, maps, letters, diagrams. They don't talk down to the readers, although two of the books use more exclamation points than you normally find in history or text books. There is a glossary in each volume and suggestions for individual and group activities based on the content. As for the historical content, it's accurate if a bit simplified -- the account of the Donner Party doesn't gloss over the possibility of cannibalism. but it doesn't dwell on it, either. I suppose it's inevitable that the Junipero Serra volume would receive the most criticism and here's mine -- the author is decidedly pro-Serra while briefly acknowledging why Serra is ""controversial."" It would be nice if sources were cited and further reading was suggested, but these are grade school resources after all, and presumably the teacher or home schooler will be able to point students in the direction of the library for more information.",4
"At first, reading the Junipero Serra book, I wasn't sure about this set. That one begins with a brutal attack on a mission by Native Americans who resent having Catholicism imposed on them. Father Serra holds someone as he dies. I was a little put off because historians are generally more sympathetic to the Indians' point of view than this.

However, reading through the series (6 books, each 32 pages), I think I understand the approach. Each book takes a different facet, even a different point of view, of early California.  Also, the writing is very age appropriate and easy to read. (California history is the fourth grade curriculum in California). Every page is colored, and every page has a lot of illustrations, usually drawings but also some photographs. It is very visually compelling and would attract most kids.

Each book begins with a dramatic event-- the attack on a mission (""Junipero Serra""); the discovery of ""Ishi"", the last of the Yani Indians (""Indian Nations""), the myth of a land of gold ruled by Queen Califa (""Exploration of California"", and so on The books are short, but there is a lot of information, well presented. There is a lot of effort to include women and girls when possible, including as illustrations.

They are unnumbered, but I'd organize them chronologically as follows:

1 - California's Indian Nations
2 -  Exploration of California
3 - Spanish Missions
4 - Junipero Serra
5 - Mexican Rule of California
6 - Trails to California

Of course there is overlap in time periods but this gives a basic chronology that begins with Indian nations and prehistoric mammals about 14,000 years ago and ends, roughly at the beginning of the 20th century.

This is produced by ""Teacher Created Materials"" and although there are no supplements with it, each book ends with several activities. as well as six comprehension (""Read and Respond"") questions suitable for writing or discussion.

It's a good series, presenting a lot of information and competing interests in early California in an interesting and clear way, full of excellent illustrations. I think teachers would find these easy to adapt to their own lessons and emphasis.",4
Only wish the water was fizzier. Its not as fizzy as Perrier or canned soda water.,4
It's hard to tell from the pic but this is not 3 dimensional as it looks. Flat book.  It is nice with all the little extras but if you need just a plain day planner you can do better on the price. I wanted something a little nicer looking and this is definitely cute but there is no wow factor.,4
"Bigger than I expected, it works",4
Easy to use and works well.,4
"I'm not a huge fan of multi-purpose tools unless they have been designed for a specific job like firefighting or some kind of rigging. But for the truck, tackle box, boat, trunk, or camp, they have their place. and this one's best feature is the combination hammer, pliers, wire cutter, and windshield breaker. The other stuff in the handle is a bonus.

I've had several multi-function tools with pliers before, and eventually you ask more of the pliers than what they are capable of doing. Next thing you know, the pliers have been torqued way out of alignment. These pliers are very robust and could be used effectively to turn a stubborn nut or pipe. It's because of the way they're shaped into the hammer head, because the hammer head needs some steel in it to be useful. But also because of the shape, the pliers are going to be best for nuts or pipe that fit into the rounded jaws. Anything too small for the rounded jaws and you'll have to use the flat part of the pliers. Any nut over 5/8"" and I think you'll find yourself with an awkward bite and handhold. Fully closed, the aperture is 3/8"". At full open, the aperture is 1"". Btw, the pliers are perfect for tightening your car battery posts, old style and new.

The tool is equipped with a windshield breaker head which makes it a good choice for the glove box. I was not all that impressed with the machining of the jack-knife tools hidden in the grips. And I could not find a seat belt cutter anywhere. It says in the product title the tool has a seat belt cutter, but there's no image of one in the product pictures, and I could not find it.

"I've been using these with my watercolor pencils (Inktense by Derwent and Aquarelle by Faber-Castell) and they are very fun. They are easy to fill up and once they are closed, they don't leak. You do have to make sure to tighten them after filling. There is a place on the barrel that says ""Push"" and you push gently on that area to get the water flowing. I would recommend having a separate piece of paper on the side to test that on first because it will give you a big drop of water the first time. After that, you don't have to push continually to keep the water flowing. These will give you a good amount of water so be sure to color on paper that is able to handle that or it will get wrinkled fairly quickly. The only thing I wish they had was a way to adjust how much water comes out because sometimes I only want a little bit of water. For those times, I sometimes push out a drop of water and empty the tip a bit and use that, because the brush will flow for awhile before you have to push on it again. If they could add a twist valve so you could reduce the flow of water, that would make them even better. I've seen that other people fill them with watercolor pigment, but I use them exclusively with my watercolor pencils so I only use them with plain water.

The bristles are nylon so they aren't going to give you the same feel as a good sable watercolor brush, meaning they are good for making strokes and pulling water across the colored pencil lines, but you won't be able to get circle shapes like with a good watercolor brush. But, for the price, you really can't expect that. You can get a nice stroke with these and because the bristles are a bit stiff, they are good for doing shading work because they hold straight so that you can so soft back and forth strokes to add a bit of water to pencil strokes and get shading. If the bristles were too soft, you couldn't do that. The brushes do have a nice point to them and because they come in three different sizes, you can do some detail work with the smaller brush.

These are also fun to use with lettering because you can use the pencils to get all your typography just like you want and then use a light touch with the small pen along the strokes to get a cool painted effect with your lettering. This will be fun when making handmade cards for people and signage for my gallery. Too many ideas of ways to use these!

While using them, you will notice that the bristles will pick up the color of the pencils you are using, but that doesn't transfer to other areas one you are done with one color. And they cleaned up fine with a little bit of hand soap. It says they are dishwasher friendly, but I haven't needed to do more than quickly hand wash them to keep them clean. The bristles are nylon so they aren't really prone to much staining. And even if they stain a bit, it doesn't affect how well they work.

I've left these half full in the bag where I keep all my colored pencils and they haven't leaked at all. They do come with a nice pouch to hold them, but if you're like me and sometimes just toss them in a bag, they won't leak as long as you keep the lids on them. And the lids snap on top when you are using them so it's easy to keep them on hand and not lose them.

I have another watercolor brush pen that I got last year and it was more than half the cost of this set, so they are a good value. And these are a bit thicker and heavier than the other one I have so they feel better in my hand and feel like they'll last longer. The other one is still working, but I wanted some different sizes and this set offered that.

Overall, I'm very happy with these and will have fun painting with them. If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know and I will answer them.",4
love the different tips and paint well with water no leakage,4
nice,4
"strong sturdy set very happy with these, I don't use the brush but the other 3 pieces work very well",4
"Very very bulky, and colors are not as bright as appears in the photo. You will not want to haul this around with you, but if you need something to stay at your desk, this would be good for you.",4
"Nice realistic barrel cones. Plastic not rubber. Could be a little heaver in weight. But I like them, can't see them being used for cakes...",4
"They look so much nicer than the stainless steel one that I was using, especially had I had burnt the old ones so many times.",4
"For my application, they did not work. I needed something to help keep my homemade sparkling water fresher than placing a piece of plastic under its regular cap. The problem was, these were not big enough in circumference sooner, so when I placed them in the hole, they were nearly flush with the opening. But the worst part was after sitting for less than a minute, they would pop off, like a cork on a champagne bottle!  Funny, but not workable. They work perfect for wine bottles though.",4
ok,4
Gave for a gift and assume it was okay.,4
"These are an excellent option for inexpensive freezer pop moulds.  Of course, making pops yourself is the only way to ensure you get exactly what you want in them in terms of sugar content.  Turns out most kids are happy with something cold, so you can definitely make healthier snacks than the typical commercial freezer-pop.  These BPA-free plastic moulds do a nice job and make fun star-shape pops.  My kids liked them with just plain water because the shape was so much fun.  The stick actually snaps into the mould so you don't even need to stand them up to get decent pops.  My only issue is that the stand isn't moulded quite deep enough to hold all of the pops, so if you do want to use it, it can be a little difficult.  But overall it's an excellent option for summer treats.

Note: I received a free sample for the purposes of review.",4
"I am a side sleeper but I like a soft pillow without too much loft but also one that stays cool.  This is just about there if it were a tad softer and had about an inch less loft.  I'll keep looking for perfect, but this company seems to be on the right track.",4
"first off - this is a QUEEN - when i got it it wasn't noted and everyone gave different sizes. you can get a standard pillow case on it, as long as you don't want slack. it does come with a pillow case is very nice- however it has polyester in it, and i don't know why i was under the impression that it was totally cotton. it was one of the reasons i got this pillow. i'm allergic to poly.

anyway, it does feel cooler than my other pillows. it's hard to rate since i'm surrounded by warm memory foam anyway. sleeping wise, i find it's a bit easier to sleep on as i have more support than my standard pillow shaped pillow (the edges taper to a point, these are rounded). however i also find my neck can hurt if my shoulders are on the pillow sleeping on my side. as long as i fall asleep with my shoulder against the edge of the pillow i'm fine usually. i no longer have neck pain when i wake up. and it's so long that i don't roll off the edge like i was doing with the old one - so queen is a good idea, though bulky and hard to travel with.

it did have a smell. its not packed in a box, i got it in a sealed envelope, looked funny on the stairs like that. but it trapped the scent in really well. remove the bag and the case and let it sit outside for a day or two. after that it still had a scent for a week or so when on top of it. and now there is no scent. the foam is encased in a pillow shroud, so it's really easy getting it into a pillow case (you don't have that foam sticking to things.) i gave it four stars due to the pillow case.",4
the set is a bit smaller than I anticipated but I bought it for a friends 2 year old and she carts the backpack around everywhere.  Great beach day/sand pit toy,4
"These are stronger than the all plastic clips I am replacing. However, they don't fit the 1/4"" holes very tightly. They do stay in place, but if you need a snug fit for the 1/4"" ones you are replacing the 5 mm sizes will not be snug. Again, they stay in with a little play.",4
"This is a well made pot, and had it a stainless steel lid instead of a glass one, I'd give it 5 stars. The lid has held up, but I don't care for that type of lid. It has held up well in the months (or has it been a year or more already?) since I bought it.",4
"I used these on my son's first birthday cake (construction themed). They were really cute, but seem to be made of thin plastic so I won't be letting my son play with them.",4
"I have a whole set of American Kitchen stainless cookware, and so far I'm very satisfied with every piece. This particular saucepan is a good weight, nicely balanced, and the perfect size for cooking veggies when company comes. The brushed steel is very attractive, and I love the see-through lid. My one complaint is that it stains more easily than other stainless cookware that I've had, but a little Barkeeper's Friend solves that problem in the blink of an eye.",4
"I've bought far more expensive, higher-grade coffee from other organic roasters but really could no longer afford the luxury. I only switched to this because I could get the free shipping via Prime. It's actually quite good -- unless you really are a coffee snob, you'll feel like you're doing something pretty decadent every time you make a mug of it. And it's shade-grown, so it's less damaging to the birds and other critters.",4
Nice looking light. Easy to crank. Not as bright as it's Eveready counterpart. The eveready is harder to crank and requires more cranks for the same length of power time. Solar is the best part. I would hope to depend on mostly solar recharge.,4
This works great covers my mountain bike but it is really labor intensive getting the sack that it comes in.,4
"My old 4 quart slow cooker wasn't cutting it anymore, and I really wanted a programmable cooker because I've never been completely comfortable leaving a cooker going without an auto shut off point. I was eyeing this cooker (which also comes in black:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hamilton-Beach-Programmable-Slow-Cooker-4-5-Quart-Cooks-4-Lb-Chicken/dp/B004KG06ZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hamilton Beach Programmable Slow Cooker 4.5 Quart Cooks 4 Lb Chicken</a>) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cuisinart-PSC-350-3-1-2-Quart-Programmable-Slow-Cooker/dp/B001E5CWVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cuisinart PSC-350 3-1/2-Quart Programmable Slow Cooker</a>&nbsp;when someone made up my mind for me and got me this one for Christmas.

Now Cuisinart's has an extra cooking temperature and longer cook and keep warm times, but this one has a larger capacity (4.5 vs. their 3.5 quart) and a wrap-around heating element. I like the wrap around heating element for even cooking, but that slight extra capacity is really nice because I can use a slightly larger cut or amount of meat and more vegetables and still have space. I also like that it doesn't have that steam vent hole because I hate those things. Your cooking progress is partially track-able because as the time lapses the light for the lower time frame lights up. So if you start at 8 hours the 8 hour light is on, then when there is under 6 hours left the 6 hour light comes on, and so on. But unless you remember exactly what time you started you don't know exactly where you are within the 2 hour increment. It's not that much of a huge deal but a countdown timer that lets you set exactly the hours and minutes you want (instead of committing to 2 hour increments) and shows exactly how much time is left would be even better. That plus one of those latching lids that Hamilton Beach has on some other models of slow cookers would make it pretty much perfect, if more expensive. The price is so low there's room for the cost of improved features as an upgraded model.

The Cuisinart still looks nice, but I really like being able to add the extra vegetables and meat and still have that comfortable 1/2 inch of space from the top of the food to the top of the crock for cooking space, so I'm still glad to have this one instead.",4
"It's a good pot: heavy enough, heats evenly, and made in the U.S.A., which is a nice plus. One mark against it is the lid has a seal between the steel and glass components that allows water to get in. I happened to discover this when some water dripped from this space into some hot oil. It was a bit of a nuisance. On the whole I liked it enough to later pick up the 12"" saute pan too.",4
"It works great and will come in handy for power outages. This is the best!
We need all the light we can get when the power goes out.
  We are ready!",4
AWSOME.......only down fall had couple dents in it. But you can't tell unless you hold it on a slant.,4
I really like magnetic bookmarks because they don't slip out and they are nice and small so storage is easy. These are fun to look at as well.,4
This was for my staff as a thank-you for all you do... They loved these book marks.. but they are a bit small!,4
Great! smaller than expected!,4
"I love these bookmarks!
Small and attractive, work great on up to 3 pages at a time.
Stay on securely.
Great gift, and affordable!  I've bought a bunch for various friends and family.
Only issue: kinda hard to open them when they are closed on themselves -- a fingernail is usually needed.",4
"I really wish Amazon would keep these in stock, apparently they're popular. If not, they should be. As a long time journaler and user of fountain pens, I have found quality notebooks lacking in the marketplace. Sure, Field Notes or Moleskines are useful for certain things, but in my experience - not when you use a fountain pen, or even a gel pen. The ink bleeds thru.

The paper in these notebooks is thick and heavy. Perfect for sketching and writing. I'm not sure of the makeup of the paper, but it gives off archival grade quality. Time will tell.

If you're looking for a step up in quality without a hike in price, definitely buy these. Buy more than you need as well, because they're not often in stock with Amazon.",4
"I was slightly disappointed
They are good... very good
but not the best",4
my husband really enjoyed this calender however we were both a little bit disappointed that none of the cartoons were new.,4
"Hardcore Dilbert fans have the books, but this calendar is especially fun for the newer fan. It is a great conversation starter if left in view on cubicle desks and reception areas.

One strip a day. Easily torn off to be posted on your office door, or that of your unsuspecting boss or favorite technical writer.

Each days looks at themes and the culture encountered in the development of technical products at a large corporation. Although tongue-in-cheek, anyone ensconced in that environment will find familiar frustrations and humorous shaping of IT life. The only challenge is occasionally, after so many years, Scott Adams' Dilbert comic strip is repetitive and cliche. However, if all of Dilbert is new to you, expect to laugh often.

"I received a copy of this to evaluate.  I am so glad that I did.

I have been homeschooling for about 15 years.  Homeschooling is rewarding, amazing, and terrifying.  The amount of chaos that goes with it is truly intimidating.  This is what makes homeschool moms a great target market for planners.  The homeschool planner market is chock full of gorgeous planners with zillions of lovely pages to use for journaling, book lists, inspiration, cute quotes, daily plans, long term plans, short term plans and every other possible page you can think of.  Keeping up the planners can be a full time job

This planner doesn't have that.  This is about as straight forward a record book as you could find.  It is for use by your student.  There is one page for basic identification and grade information.  There is one page to list the general syllabus for each course.  There is one page to list the texts used for each subject.  And then, there are 180 pages designed to record all your academic activities for each day.  Every possible category is listed in a way that encourages you to look not just at typical assigned seatwork but also at activities and field trips.  One page for one day.  There is nothing else to this book.  I wouldn't really want anything else except perhaps space for a reading record.

If you want a beautiful planner with inspirational quotes and lots of sections keep looking.  If you want a simple straight forward planner that will help with excellent record keeping by you and your student- get this one.  Heck, at under 6 bucks it isn't worth the trouble to make your own.

I have just cancelled my (backordered) order for much more expensive planners for my kids and ordered 4 more of The Complete Homeschool Planner and Journal.  Simple is great.",4
"Great price! This is exactly what I was looking for. We homeschool independently and I wanted a record of what we do each day for law purposes. I do not use it to write out full lesson plans. It's very basic but is great for keeping attendance and listing what you did each day.  All subjects are listed out so you can fill them in. The kids never see this, this is purely for my records.",4
very thorough and details galore to write what you need if you are a homeschool parent,4
Nice big squares.  Simple.  We always have lots going on so I need plenty of space to write.  My only complaint is it has every holiday imaginable on it which takes up some of the space.,4
"The dates of the Moon Cycles are incorrect, but otherwise, I love the pictures.",4
"Another nice cat calendar, probably my third yoga cat calendar!",4
Very nice calendar!,4
Beautiful pictures.,4
"I love the set up of the notebook and the whole aesthetic , I only wish there were more notes pages and that the paper were thicker, almost all my pens fully ghost through the pages.

Also notes for creatives who like to decorate/glam up their planner, this planner is pretty small and crammed by the layout, so would not recommend if you want to use Washi tape/sticky notes/etc. this is for the minimalists.",4
"As far as a Planner goes, I would give this 5 stars. The quality of the cover and paper are nice. It is almost everything I would want in a journal. There aren't that many blank pages and nothing you can substitute for an Index page. I would buy these every single year if it were just the monthly then weekly then nothing but blank pages!",4
"Very cute book, but I think it's a little expensive for what it is.",4
"These are very convenient for over the door storage. I also purchased the longer red ones, which I recommend more if you require more pockets.",4
"Wasn't sure it would hold up due to the way they are assembled, but so far so good!",4
"great quality, I like how sturdy and thick it is. Only enough for me to do two small bulletin boards.",4
"Love these folders, hold everything I need it too. Awesome colors, not the traditional manila folders.",4
"This comes in a roll. I was excited at first, but then I attempted to hang this up. Most of the time, bulletin board border comes in predetermined lengths usually around 4 feet long. So you end up with some short pieces you can't do much with. I was thinking this would be great because you wouldn't have any small or short pieces. When trying to get this hung up, I quickly realized that it's a pain. I suggest you lay out your piece and cut it. Then you can hang it up. I'm still giving it four stars because it is true to color as shown. It's also very sturdy so I could use it many times over.",4
Great buy,4
"I had a mixed experience with this.

Pros:
1- It was thick enough that I was able to pull on it (to get it tight) when I was putting on my bulletin boards and it didn't break.
2- I have had it in my office for months now and the color is as vibrant as when I put it up
3-It adds just enough emphasis to decorate my board but not distract from the material on the board

Con:
1- I had a hanging file fall down the wall (another story) and it ended up ripped just by rubbing past it. I taped the sides back together but it made me wonder about durability despite my experience when I first put it up

Overall, I am still happy with it. It's great for the price that I paid and seems to be lasting as long as nothing else rubs/puts too much pressure on it.",4
Great quality and price,4
"These file folders are so fun and colorful! I like using them because they are easier to find within the file cabinet.
I would give it all five stars if there were perforations available to fold the folders for thicker contents. I just fold my own, imperfectly. They are good as-is for smaller contents though.",4
"These stars are eye catching and every student will want one so they will work to get them. In this package, you get 39 stars - 12 large, 12 medium and 15 small. The medium and large stars have a white center that you can write names, areas and notes for your students and classroom. The small stars can be given to the student of the week. These are printed on heavy card stock and are durable - as long as they are not mis-used. They are brightly colored foil on the edges and have rainbow colors. If you know a teacher, buy a couple for their classroom because if a classroom is to be personalized or decorated, the products have to be paid for by the teacher. There is no budget available for these types of items. And a decorated room makes for an area where learning is more enjoyable",4
Nice big stickers. They are very sticky which is good. A good amount of them. These are going to go to my daughters kindergarten teacher.,4
"These sturdy stars make cute decorations. The colors are pretty and the gold has some shine. They do not sparkle. They have no glitter but re pretty  nonetheless. These are not adhesive; you must tack, tape or hang them yourself. They are nicely mde with a good mix of sizes.",4
Larger than I wanted. But nice heavy leave at homebook.,4
"Cute, but no tabs and no extra space if the address changes in the future.",4
"The Norman Rockwell Address Book is functional and artistic at the same time. Besides the cute cover, there are other reproductions of Rockwell's work, with commentary, throughout the book. It is permanently spiral bound, so you cannot move pages around from one letter to another should you have more ""S"" names than ""Y"", for example. That, and the fact that the pages are slick rather than absorbent (I like to use rollerball pens versus ball point) is the only reason I rated it less than five stars. There is room for the name, address, various phone and fax numbers and email addresses on each entry. I am very happy with this phone book, in spite of the fact that I'm going to have to use a different pen than I like to add names to it.",4
Exactly what I ordered.  I am going to use the in paper crafts.  Love it.,4
"I was hoping that these would be more like cardstock and they're actually quite thin, but they're great for things like SmashBooks, altered & junk journals etc.",4
"While these notebooks are pricier than I would prefer, I still like them to use at work. For the most part they are pretty sturdy. This is the third one I have purchased. The first one I bought lasted a little over a year until I dropped it and the binding in the back tore. The second one I purchased lasted for for over a year until I filled out every page. I particularly like the graph paper versions. My job requires the occasional construction sketch. If you like keeping a dedicated work notebook then these are an excellent choice. If the price was a little cheaper I would have no problem giving them a 5 out of 5.

Update: I have tried the Moleskin equivalent, which is nice, but I still prefer the Piccadilly version. The Moleskin have much darker grid lines and the binding is not as flat as the Picadilly ones. Next I will try Google's version, but for now the Piccadilly are my favorite.",4
"These are a great addition of my Zantangle books.  The cards are small and feature a design on front, with step by step directions on the back.  My middle school students also enjoy using these when Zentangling in class.  They are portable and easy to carry with you wherever you go.",4
These tangle cards are fun to work with and I've enjoyed them. The step outs are most helpful.,4
This is one of the books in this series that is useful and has some good ideas and patterns for Zen mandalas.,4
nice,4
"I like the layout of the book and appreciate the large size. It is difficult to find plan books with more than six periods. I wish the record book didn't need to be purchased separately. I don't know a teacher who wants separate books, so combining them is preferable. I hate that plan books contain a bunch of extra, useless pages that no one ever uses. It's wasteful. This could ne improved by adding a thicker cover and lowing the dorky design. I like the spiral binding.",4
great,4
"I expected it to be bigger. I was hoping for large blocks to write in--- like I did years ago (I recently returned to teaching after working in guidance for seven years) The entire book is not much larger than 8 1/2 by 11. I will make do and the price was pretty inexpensive, which is great, probably because most people do digital plans nowadays. I just wanted something that I could carry around the classroom with me just as little reminders as I move from one topic to the next.",4
"I love these bookmarks but it has one small annoyance that bugs me.  The pattern that is on the front is not exactly the same on the back.  As shown in my photo the pretty shading is only present on the front.  They just opted for a solid color on the back and put copyright and company info.  While I understand the need to put this info on the product somewhere, I wish they would have at least put the same shading on the back.  I use these in a planner and I do see both sides, not just the front.  Just a minor quibble but still something to be aware of.",4
work great for me to keep chapters in my school books separated.,4
"Great bookmark but hard to open, as one buyer suggested, cut a corner on one end to make it easy to pry open",4
"Overall, I like these markers.  I got the pastel ones.  Quality may not be superb but they do the job
Pros:
1.  Small and light so will not weigh down/tear the page
2.  Like the colors
3.  Good price for the number of bookmarks in the box.  I have a lot of books that I read at the same time and wanted a bunch of bookmarks.

Cons:
1. They're completely plain so you need to mark which side of the bookmark is the one you stopped at.  I used a sharpie and made a mark on one side.
2.  They may move a little.  I don't think they would fall off altogether, but i haven't used it that much in a bag or something.
3.  Magnet is not that strong.  Use it over one or two pages only, it will not hold any more than that.
4.  You will start to see creases when you use them where you have bent the bookmark.",4
These work great.  I use them all the time in my home office,4
"great little book marks... a little bit too magnetic I am a little fearful of tearing delicate pages with them, but everyone seems to like them",4
"Great value, for sure; if I could have two improvements, 1) cut the ends differently to allow ease of opening to slide onto a page, and 2) put a mark on one side to point to the line you left off at.  But these are minor issues - I marked one side with a felt-tip pen to differentiate.",4
"These work great! I have loved using magnetc bookmarks for awhile now, and these work great.
One thing I noticed that's different from others I've gotten, is that the magnetic strip goes all the way along the length of the bookmark. In my past purchases, I've noticed that it's usually two different magnets that are separated in the middle where the fold is.
So far, I haven't noticed any issues with this difference, but as I use them more, I have a feeling the folded areas will start to peel. (The other kinds rip at the folds after many uses as well, so I'm not sure the quality is going to be affected.)
My set came with two of each color, and it's worked out well as I use them in textbooks. I usually have one at the start of the chapter, or however far I've gone, and one at the start of the next chapter so I can see how far I have to go for reading assignments.",4
"I really like these. They hold your page without falling out if you turn a book over and shake it. It's only meant for holding one or two pages, it can't handle much more than that, but I would't want it too as it would make getting it off harder. Unfortunately, I couldn't use this for what I'd bought it for. I had wanted to use it for my Bullet Journal, but they are so thick that the journal doesn't close properly. You might mark one page at a time with just one, but you can't mark multiple pages with them. I decided to just use post-it flags for that. The other problem is that they aren't marked on one side, so if you mark your line where you stopped reading, when you come back you have to guess if you stopped on the front  or the back of the page! So, I put star stickers on one side of them so I can tell what page I was on. Not terrible, but a little annoying. Overall, I like them and would buy them again. I really like the colors too!

Update: I still use these all the time and am here to buy more because I keep losing them by putting them on library books and forgetting to take them off before I return the book! Oops.",4
good in theory.  I need a medium vs a large.  Small hands.,4
"Works alright, but is not the best if you are reading while lying down (with the book above you)",4
My wife and I absolutely love this stuff. Calendar makes a nice addition to your kitchen--great conversation piece as well!,4
great item price NEEDS to go down,4
"We use this daily, sometimes even multiple times a day.  In fact, we really only use the Uncoated book, so the Coated book is useless to us.  )for most people it is the other way around, they used the Coated but not the uncoated).  Because of our heavy use of it, combined with the recommendation we must replace the book annually (yes, we can see the colour fade), we do have to replace it annually.

For best results if you are an occasional user, I strongly recommend storing it in a dark place (desk drawer) and you can get much longer use from it without having to replace it as often.",4
"4 stars only because as the other reviewers already stated, the binding was a bit damaged but nothing a bit of glue stick couldn't fix. The pages are thin and do show through if you're using a pen, but it's not horribly distracting. Overall, I love the design and it shipped quickly. Plenty of pages and would recommend for other students.",4
"The design is gorgeous but the black strip at the edge has started coming up. It doesn't seem like the notebook is coming apart, but that strip on the side is starting to come off, and it isn't like this thing gets beat up. The rest of it feels like good quality though and I'm glad it's college-ruled.",4
"The art on the notebook is lovely as is the concept of using recycled material and no harsh chemicals to bind the pages. The pages themselves are also not too thin which is a plus for all pen users (like me) who get frustrated when the ink leaks through the paper, making it hard to read when writing on the front and back of a sheet. The one I got however, was badly glued in the front. I understand that, as I mentioned, no harsh, chemical-laden adhesive is used, but the back holds perfectly together. Only the front has a problem, leading me to assume that this notebook I received is defective. I get (and find it cute) that the brand name plays on the idea of the easy decomposition of recycled material, but I fear mine is unfortunately literally decomposing.",4
"Other than being mildly crushed on the spine and many of the pages being wrinkled, it's a great composition book. I've been using it as a lab notebook in my little chemistry lab in the garage. The college rule is really nice, and the paper within is pretty good too.",4
"This is a great composition book. The pages are thick enough that my pens do not bleed through, and it lays flat as you use it--an ENORMOUS plus in my book. I look forward to filling all the pages with my notes come the fall semester. And what a gorgeous cover! I adore it.",4
"I like these notebooks very much. They are much more stylish than the typical notebooks and easy to tell apart from each other. They also have humorous writing on the inside covers. However, as other reviewers have noted, they don't stand up to much abuse. I used some super glue to lay the binding tape back down when it started to peel, and so far I haven't had any more issues. Note: I most noted the damage occurring when I left a pen/pencil inside. Earlier in the quarter, when I was less hectic, and putting all my writing utensils away consistently, they didn't show any wear at all. So, if you love the design, they work. Just have some super glue, and put away your pencils.",4
part of a gift - very nice,4
"Ordered a few of these bookmarks and really like them. Sturdy and stylish. I read a great deal of books and unfortunately don't always finish one before moving on to the next, so I need a steady supply of bookmarks and this was a good addition to my collection.",4
Love it! Looks just as pictured. The tassel has fallen apart but it's fine.,4
"Expected the card to be less flimsy, but bead string and ruler on the back is nice.",4
Nice saying!,4
"These are adorable and effective but I thought they were going to be much larger for some reason!
If you have large fingers or not that great of fine motor skills, you will probably find it a tad difficult to open these little guys.
Things I DO like are that they have the arrow on the back so that you can mark where you are on the side of the page if you want. I think these would be Fantastic for textbooks and studying because you can put multiple ones in the book and it won't bulk it up.
They hold well and you could use them to hold onto multiple pages if you needed or wanted to.
They were very inexpensive and kinda cute as well.",4
"I feel like this is something I could have made at home with a couple of stickers and magnet strips. However, 4 stars because I did not have to make them.",4
"It's hard to find a good bookmark these days without it having fancy magnets, tassels, or some media reference.
-  It has a tassel
+ You can take it off
+ It's a good bookmark",4
"I like it a lot, but the bead left an indent on the bookmaker that won't come out.",4
"Cute, just a little smaller than I had expected but very well made",4
"Like using these, bought my pack at B&N. Happy with what they are, simple product that does what it is described to do. The clip can slide off if you have the book in a bag and it is moving around, but for the most part I find that they stay put. Nice to have a 8 pack so that I have enough for all of the books I'm in the middle of reading.",4
"This is a really pretty old world map bookmark, with a nice maroon tassel.  (My cats LOVE that tassel!) But one star off for only having an image on one side.",4
EXCELLENT,4
"I love these bookmarks!
Small and attractive, work great on up to 3 pages at a time.
Stay on securely.
Great gift, and affordable!  I've bought a bunch for various friends and family.
Only issue: kinda hard to open them when they are closed on themselves -- a fingernail is usually needed.",4
They do what they are meant to do. It's nice that they came in an eight pack because you always need multiple bookmarks,4
This was for my staff as a thank-you for all you do... They loved these book marks.. but they are a bit small!,4
another good bookmark!!!,4
nice bookmark. well made product. happy with this purchase. highly recommend this is your looking for a good bookmarker for your book,4
Very nice as a gift for a friend.,4
Made a great gift.,4
Wish it were laminated,4
Great buy!,4
"Good, it works.",4
"A review on a bookmark?  Sure!

Listen, Pauper's bookmarks are great.  They have great images, quotes, and are of a industry standard card stock and lamination.

They slide in and out of the pages well, and never fall out.

My only problem is that the threads at the end of the tassel fall out under the slightest pressure.  This situation, like say where they get trapped under something heavy, is something that shouldn't happen, but on the occasion it does, be prepared to see five or six of them to fall out, even if you carefully remove the heavy item from them.

Great bookmarks just the same!",4
"Great bookmark, it gets the job done.",4
"I love to read so my bookmarks get worn out pretty fast. I bought this one and the ""yin yang"" and ""sun"" bookmarks as well. They are made of thick paper, so they might not last long if you use them a lot but they are pretty and I love the quotes and the beads! They come in a plastic cover you can leave the bookmark in there if you want it to last longer.",4
A nice looking bookmark that is nothing new but does what's it's supposed to do! There's nothing much more to say.,4
"This bookmark is beautifully printed.  The design is crisp and very detailed!  The tassel is a nice touch and matches the colors of the print well.  I use this while reading survival adventure novels and it only feels right, but I wish it were a bit thicker.  Being careful and using the protective sleeve, this bookmark should last good a long time.  I also wish that the print were on both sides.. but still not bad for a unique inexpensive bookmark..",4

Cute bookmark.,4
wish the silver piece was actual metal and not plastic but it does its job.,4
They them as gifts whenever I purchase a book for a friend.,4

Very useful,4
Nice address book.,4
"This arrived quickly, is very cute but the reason I am giving this 4 stars is due to the fact that it does not include a separate line for birthdays, as it is advertised. This was a feature I was hoping for and expecting, given how horrible I am at remembering dates. I will note that if your handwriting is sizable, the limited space on these pages may pose an issue. Thankfully, I have very compact and precise handwriting so this works fine for me.
Other than the lack of a birthday line, this address book is conveniently sized, appears to be well made and is a great addition to my purse (in the event I ever lose my phone - since I have lost the ability to memorize phone numbers or contact information!)",4
"This address book is very small, I bought it for my purse as I already have a large personal address book in my desk. I believe it was meant for a ladies purse, backpack or briefcase.
I rate it 4 stars because it is very small and the writing space is rather tight and confined. However, since I have a smaller handwriting, it works OK for me.

Below I list details of this addressbook:

* Writing area/suggestions  - This has lines for needed info such as name, address, cellphone, phone, and email. However,  I had to write very small with my blue Pilot Gel pen. This way I can easily read the names, phone numbers, etc. I have a small to medium handwriting so this address book works well for me personally.
****If you have a smaller handwriting, this address book SHOULD work OK for you. However, if you have a large handwriting, I cannot recommend it to you.

* Overall construction and quality- Excellent. The cover us a hard cover that has a slightly textured material (washable with damp cloth). The cover is hard and sturdy with an elastic closure.

* Dividers A to Z on pages...easy to use, in my opinion.

* Quality of paper is OK, I would liked to see a bit thicker paper. This is the one thing I did not like.

* Special features....my favorites...a closing band to kept this book closed in my purse. It is PINK!

My suggestions:

For this low price, this is a wonderful and attractive phone book. The one thing that is not great is the paper is a bit thin. Other than that, I give this 4.6 stars rounded off to 5 stars. And a great book to keep on hand with handwritten names/addresses, etc.

Be sure you take your time and write small using this book, and all should be OK.

Overall, I think this is a perfect address book for me. AND I am happy with my purchase.",4
"A little bulky for the purse, which is what I wanted it for. But well made and attractive.",4
This address book is super cute and small.  I really like it and it helps keep me organized which is good!,4
"I actually wanted the ""Little Black Book"" for email addresses.  This one is okay.",4
Nothing fancy and not quite as described but it is nice anyway and will be used a lot. Great deal for the price,4
"Very nice.  my daughter reads a lot and likes ""celestial"" things....a perfect match",4
"I love to read so my bookmarks get worn out pretty fast. I bought this one and the ""shoot for the moon"" and ""yin yang"" bookmarks as well. They are made of thick paper, so they might not last long if you use them a lot but they are pretty and I love the quotes and the beads! They come in a plastic cover you can leave the bookmark in there if you want it to last longer.",4
Very useful,4
Very efficient book for the money,4
I bought these for my mother for a pen given to her as a gift.  She says they work very well.,4
good for the money,4
good quality,4
Arrived on time and as described!!,4
Very surdy,4
Great Book,4
"Great little book for addresses and phone numbers. Small enough to throw in your purse or hide away in a drawer. The only downturn is that the black material on the outside starts looking very dirty shortly. Every fingerprint and greasy hand mark shows up immediately. Sometimes they go away, sometimes they don't. The book is bound very well and I'm sure it'll last me for forever. Lots of pages with front and back sides. With striped accents on the inside covers. Would definitely recommend!",4
great!,4
"A pretty little address book with a comic title. It holds all my contacts, in alphabetical order. Though, you only get two pages for each letter, so if you have a bunch of Johns and Jane's you might not fit them all.

I also want to point out it is a fairly small book, with small writing space. If you're like me, with a big sized handwriting, that could be an issue.",4
"smaller then i expect, but it's a good quality book",4
"good quality, could use a few more pages",4
It's a little black book for sure. All I needed will work good,4
It suits my purpose.,4
Seems well made.,4
"Yes, it is small, but I like that! Read the product descriptions before making the purchase if you are afraid of size. I have a planner that I take with me everywhere and this happily sits in the zipper section on said planner. The only thing I found frustrating was the spiral aspect. Because you cannot really bend the binding it is tough to write in such small lettering. But, it does what I wanted and I am happy with this purchase overall.",4
not little,4
"An excellent wire bound address book covered with hard cardboard covers and surfaced with a moleskin feel. The book even sports an elastic security strap attachment to keep it closed. I would have rated this 5 stars, but considering the book's dimensions are 4 1/4 by 6 3/8 inches, the lines for entering information and the various phone numbers are just too close together IMHO. Still a great little address book which does what it was designed for!",4
"It is exactly as advertised.  I wish it were a little smaller and a lot lighter.  My purse is burdened as is.  That being said, it was the best I could find for the price.",4
"The photos do not give you the right view of this address book. It is small, like as big as your hand. Small and basic. Not much details. The only reason I didn't return it, is because my husband liked it. A positive note is that each letter has plenty of pages. Not the basic 1-2 pages. More like 4 pages each letter. So it will do as a back up for our iPad.",4
"I bought several of these two years ago. The bookmark is indeed coated and waterproof. It doesn't tear and can't be easily bent or creased. The ones I bought have lasted well, so I know they're durable. The designs in this series are typically very colorful and attractive. The tassel is a nice finishing touch.

As a product, this gets five stars. As a deal, it gets three stars. I'm pretty sure you could go to any stationery store and get these for under $2. However, buying through Amazon does offer considerably more convenience than searching locally for bookmarks.

I would tend to buy this as a small gift item. For something like that, this is definitely recommended.",4
AWSOME.  Came quick.  Good size. Love it. Worth every penny,4
Although I love it but it's pretty over-priced!,4
Sturdy bookmark. My niece will love it as she likes owls.,4
"As expected, perfect for decorating walls or boards.",4
Cute but they aren't durable unless you have access to a laminating machine.,4
"This is a nice product. You can create your own index, the recipes pages are numbered, there are two pages per recipe, a section to put special note and comment, a sections for nutritional information, and a section to place a photo of the finished product. I am very happy with this product.",4
NOT LAMINATED!! Multiple reviews state that this map is laminated but it is NOT laminated. Otherwise it is a great and very detailed map.,4
"The colors are excellent and there are a good amount of cities listed.  I'm using it on a wall in my den to glance at if someone mentions where they live.  I'm only giving a star off because the lamination is so thin. However, maybe that's good because so far I just have it stuck up with scotch tape.",4
"The map wasn't laminated as firmly as I expected or would have liked, but nontheless is a great map to put on a wall. One of my favorite world maps.",4
great for topography. some stronger contrast of colors among states would be okay,4
"I wanted a map to frame and hang in my living room. I like being able to reference places on the news as well as having a reference for conversations that involve traveling. (For some reason I have those conversations a lot.) But I also wanted something that DIDN'T look like it belongs in a 5th-grade social studies classroom. This map is perfect for that. It's very pleasing to the eye and feels more like a ""grown up"" map than most of the ones I've seen that use different solid colors to separate the states. It's also very nice to have the bordering parts of Canada and Mexico visible.

The level of detail is very nice. I've lived in a few very small towns and most of them are actually listed on this map! The font choice is excellent as well.

I will agree with another reviewer who said that it's somewhat difficult to find or follow the names of mountain ranges. That's really my only knock against it. To be fair though, there's only so much room, and I personally care more about being able to read the roads, towns, lakes and state names than the mountain ranges.",4
"Awesome purchase, but the size is overwelming and definately not cheap if you plan on framing it. The color and print on it is great and legible.",4
good,4
"Once again, National Geographic did not disappointment me.  This map is so cool!  I love the detail and coloring.  I really like the fact that NG did not make the ocean and seas blue.  Definitely Executive Style!",4
"Great map in very stylish colors from NG. The only reason I give it 4 out 5 is that laminating plastic is little bit thin so when I stick it nails, it tore further up so I had to keep it tension free.",4
I mounted this map on a cork board in my HAM shack and find it adequate for my needs but the lamination causes unwanted reflections when it is viewed from any distance that is not 90 degrees  perpendicular to the face of the map.,4
"very big, nice contrast on the colors for look and viewability.  Very large, nice laminatin, best map deal around by 5 fold.",4
"Came on time and looked as expected, It will be a gift so I will be waiting to see how much the receiver likes it.",4
The only downside is finding a stock frame.,4
"Although I enjoyed this book , it was not what I thought it would be. There was less information than I had hoped for but the information that WAS there was good information. Helpful and original , I really enjoyed the pictures and the tips but thought it could be more informative.",4
"This is a decent product, but a little bulky and sometimes the pieces get loose.",4
Arrived on time.  The bottom bars fall out easily when it is moved.,4
Love the double sided stand.  But seems to be top heavy with charts on it.  Had to put something heavy on the bottom rack so that I could roll it or turn it without it tipping.,4
Makes for a fun little gift. & I mean little. Like the size of a checkbook.,4
I really like all the Knock Knock pads I have ordered. each one is fun and is made of good quality heavy paper.,4
"I made my own ""Problem Solver"" form a few years back. This is similar and pretty cool.  It helps when you can't ""Think outside the box"" on decisions or problems.",4
Handy.,4
Super handy and useful - we're big fans!,4
"I saw these in a small bookstore that I like to go to and had to go back to get another pad of notes for me and another for a friend to send off in a care package.  They are just funny.....I would say if you are buying these solely for their stickiness I have seen better and I have seen much worse.  They are mid grade on that and also on the thickness of the paper.  For sheer fun though, these will be the ones hands down.  Anyone that stumbles on these at my house thinks they are fabulous, and I do too!  This company has several other designs which are all great.  If you need to make someone laugh, and they are one to use this term often, they will appreciate them.  In the corner, you can also check the ?, ! or ?! box.  Enough said here, 5 star for clever, one star off because they could have been a little bit higher quality, but, eh, WTF, I still like 'em.",4
Referencing the Mental Note style: Definitely great quality and exactly what I ordered but still pricey for what you're getting. Made a cute gift for a Psychology Department though!,4
Did take notice of the size. They are smaller than normal but will work for giving students positive feedback. They were a great price.,4
This pad is easy to use and has made me prioritize those things I keep putting off. It's amazing what a check mark can do to motivate you. I might even buy some stickers to go with it.,4
"Not as funny as first appeared but still cute. The ""apology"" note pad is hysterically funny and I highly recommend that one.",4
"I really do love these notepads, I have one for meal planning from the same people, and I love this one almost as much. This is a great way to keep track of all the little things I need to do around the house but always manage to forget about. I like having a dedicated place for household to do stuff only, it makes it easier to find what I'm looking for. Also this has a magnet on the back, so it can easily go up on the refrigerator.",4
"My aunt says thi all the time ""Just sayin..."" so its her birthday present along with a few other things.

One star away for the small size.",4
Bought as a gift-she loved it. Very cute notes.,4
Great gift,4
Thought would be bigger. Did not read description right.,4
"Fun little sticky note that is more entertaining that the plain ones you find in stores. the text on it makes it stand out more, and is more likely to be looked at often.",4
"These are a lot smaller than I thought they would be, but they are cute and I like the color.",4
"I am using these in my classroom and the children love them.  We tend to use many sticky notes for memos, and they come in handy.  I am a bit put off by the price.  I wish they were cheaper, hence the 4 star rating",4
My supervisor love this for Christmas.,4
want to make a statement....  oy!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
"These are cute, if you still use paper in your office!",4
"I like this, it is only 5 days though.  It is cute.",4
"Funny and cute, but small!",4
Good gag gift,4
"I bought this pad, along with several other Knock Knock Notepads for co-workers this Christmas. They are really neat and unique enough to make them smile.

They are a bit pricey for a simple note pad but I would recommend them to a friend.",4
"I bought a bunch of these Knock Knock sticky notes and they are all hilarious. I use them at work to joke around with my coworkers and my students. They are funny, but I'm not really sure that it was worth all the money. Seemed overly expensive for small amount of sticky notes.",4
a bit too large for my work space but the concept is awesome :),4
Great and funny too!,4
My son refuses to use the school planner so he tapes one of these in his binder for the week.,4
Bought these for a co-worker who is moving up and on. They're very cute and naughty without being naughty. :),4
"Good size. Not enough room for my checklists, though!",4
This pad is slightly smaller than a regular piece of 8.5x11 paper and gives you seven lines for each day plus a spot to remember things to do the next week.  If you need Sat/Sun this is not the pad for you as it only has weekdays.  I wish this were college-ruled so I could have more items per day.,4
Okey,4
Good strong sturdy  materials. I even like the slightly sassy sayings on the folder. I'd give them 3.5 stars if possible.,4
very cute had a lot of fun with this at work,4
Love these post it notes. Not as sticky as post-it brand but I often tape them onto things so it's not an issue.,4
"Love the knock knock pads and have bought many of them before.  Thought I had ordered the one that said seriously bc my coworker yells it about 10 times a day so was getting for her but ended up with the one w the high duce/awesome pads. Still worked out as gave to niece and nephew for school.  They don't stick the best but they still do what they are supposed to do, take notes.",4
I use this for my co-workers daily and they love it! :),4
"These are a great gift for those who are sticky-note afflicted.  I'd rathe replace the ""To Ponder"" notes with something more actionable, such as ASAP.  But overall a useful assortment.",4
These are fun but I don't care for the small print at the bottom with reinterpretations of the acronyms. When I say tmi I mean tmi and not too many idiots. I white out the bottom when I leave these for friends.,4
Fair....the font takes up a bit too much room.,4
"I first bought this as a practical joke for someone who likes to leave little to-do or unique post it notes all over and, before I knew it several more were ordered as they were such a hit.  Sure, there are a lot of to do type of notes out there, but the ones that get the continual comments (and more attention) are the ponder and put of stickies.

Be sure to apply them firmly as the sticky stuff on the back really only has a one-time application.  If you're looking for something different, and sure to draw attention and comments, I would recommend these sticky notes.",4
I like these.  They are colorful and easy to write on.  Unlike the other reviewer I have no problem with the adhesive.  The notes have successfully stuck up to a whole week to every surface I've put it on.  I just wish the pads were bigger.  Almost half the sticky notes are covered up by the day of the week at the top.  Wouldn't be a problem if the space to write on was a little bigger.,4
Endless fun.,4
good fun if co workers or friends have a similar sense of humor!,4
Better price on Amazon than I have found in stores on this exact product. Have given this has a house warming gift as well as a Christmas present and it continues to get laughs months later. Nothing like a good bathroom joke!,4
it was funny,4
Yes! The kit is all that.  I will have fun with these in my lending library.,4
"fun
handed out at the office to everyone",4
I've received nothing but complements from my coworkers wanting me to drop one on these on their favorite PITA. I only wish they were post it type notes with some type of non-marring sticky back instead of having to use tape.,4

"I bought a bunch of these Knock Knock sticky notes and they are all hilarious. I use them at work to joke around with my coworkers and my students. They are funny, but I'm not really sure that it was worth all the money. Seemed overly expensive for small amount of sticky notes.",4
"This pad is hilarious. Makes it easy to ""apologize"" for any offense. As the back of the pad says, ""Defuse conflicts and pouting! Get brownie points for sensitivity!"" The downsides: the description says you get three pads...you get one. It is a lot smaller than I thought...not the 6x9 like the jumbo pads.",4
Love this! I've given a couple out already and it always gets a laugh. Wish I'd have read the description because the pad is a little smaller than I expected.,4
"I bought a bunch of these Knock Knock sticky notes and they are all hilarious. I use them at work to joke around with my coworkers and my students. They are funny, but I'm not really sure that it was worth all the money. Seemed overly expensive for small amount of sticky notes.",4
"This is the size of post it notes, I had thought they were a bit larger.  bummer, a bit.  Even just an inch larger, these would be perfect

It is a good gift for a friend that says this saying a lot.",4
I really like all the Knock Knock pads I have ordered. each one is fun and is made of good quality heavy paper.,4

I love these pads,4
"Got this a few days ago and took it with me to show my co-workers. They thought it was hilarious and we've had a good time ""making the list"". The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the spaces are super small and it's hard to fit all your grievances in ;)",4
"Kind of expensive, but fun!",4
Short and simple. Mom enjoyed it,4
"Cute book. Very small, about two inches high and 3.5 inches wide",4
"WAY overpriced.  I made a photo book for my mom and picked and chose some 'what i love about mom' entries.  I found about 1/2 of the ideas in this little book to be usable, a few others inspired me to come up with my own and the rest I felt didn't comfortably apply or were too close to being repetitive.  It was very useful in inspiring a keepsake photo book that my mom loves and cherishes.",4
fantastic book for moms' gifts. just note that it is small.,4
"This product is super cute. I went through it quickly when I first received it and the fill in the blanks are very easy to think of things to write and it allows for creativity, which I love. I did minus one star because it is a tad smaller in size than I had imagined, but then again I may have a large imagination. I do write fairly big so it may be difficult for me personally to write a lot on the page. To be honest, this product is cute, well priced and came packaged well with no dents or bent pages (which would have driven me crazy- OCD!). My mother will love it because it is creative and can be personalized, so all in all, this is a good purchase.",4
This is such a cute book for children and adults a like! I bought it for my mom and I am in my twenties. It was actually very entertaining filling out the cute questions and thinking up creative answers. She really enjoyed reading it and got quite a few smiles out of it. The book was somewhat smaller than I expected it to be but I'm not complaining on that behalf at all. The book is very simple and it shouldn't take any longer than thirty minutes to an hour to fill out if that. It's simple and cute. It has some silly questions and some really good ones that we may not have ever thought of on our own. It's worth it and it's sure to put a smile on your moms face.,4
"Lots of lines and space for writing lists, however I usually keep mine on the fridge so it would have been nice if it had a magnet on the back. I just added one to the back of mine though.",4
Pretty cool & just a sort of neat way to work out your frustrations. I like it.,4
Really great sense of humor!,4
"This is a really cute pad. I got it to give to my therapist, and she loves it. Great gift.",4
"Cute, but my students always comment on how there's not enough words. I wish there was an add-on pack for this.",4
good quality,4
Works as intended.,4
These charts are great....but be ware I did not notice that some do not come laminated and came rolled. this made a mess of the poster. I recommend getting only the laminated version.,4
"Bought for my daughter who is a Kindergarten teacher and needed resources. Product came quick, good quality and she likes it.",4
this is a good product to use for kids to learn numbers and etc. my kids love this and it is good.,4
"it's a 100 number chart.  very straightforward.  i do like that there aren't many embellishments - i find that too many ""learning aids"" are very distracting and busy.  as a teacher, i appreciate the simplicity of this.  it's fun to use this to look for number patterns, especially ones that go diagonally!",4
All of my boarders fit with the length. I can't close it because I overstuffed it. I do like it better them the long cardboard box I had for years.,4
Great for organization,4
"Was nice, quality was good - when I filled it up it was very heavy and awkward to carry.  Does the job.",4
"This is a perfect carrying case for border/sentence strips. The only complaint that I have is that if you pick it up while it's open from loading it lying flat, all of the contents dump out (personal experience - very frustrating).",4
I like these a lot  but it would be nice if it came with everything I need to put it together like velcro dots or a pin for the arrows.,4
works as promised,4
This has all of the pieces I was looking for.  It's not very sturdy so will definitely need to get it laminated.,4
"This bag could stand to be a little bit larger, however it is durable and serves its purpose well. I store most of my school posters (some don't fit) in these and I also use them to store my children's art work.",4
I use these in my classroom for phonics games.,4
"Wish it had some dividers to organize the posters, but otherwise this has worked perfectly to keep them out of the way, but visible and protected.",4
"This works fine for it's intended purchase of storing posters for my classroom. The big issue some might have is the Velcro doesn't align, so it's difficult to close. I don't want to return it because I need it for storing my materials this summer. There is a newer version of this that may be improved.",4
"Didn't fit over the back of my daughter's little desk chair and I assumed it would. Love the idea and the pockets, sewing is high quality. Just make sure you measure and pay attention to the size of chair you are wanting it for.",4
very good,4
"This was a bit wrinkled and folded during shipment (I was surprised no protective cover was put on it), but we had planned on cutting it into smaller flashcards anyway, so it really wasn't too big of a deal for us.  If you're intending on using it on a wall, you might reconsider having it shipped, but then again, maybe our experience was unique.  Either way, it's a great little chart for my 7- and 8-year-old daughters to start familiarizing themselves with their basic multiplication facts.  We cut ours out and put it on a ring, so they flip through the cards and quiz each other.  It's a great car activity or activity in the grocery store... keeps them busy, learning, and having fun!",4
"Bigger than expected, fun to leave messages.  I am fond of penguins, so office staff recognize not is from me right away.",4
If it is a panda I will usually buy it and I have many uses for the larger sized notepad.,4
Good.,4
"Easy schedule holder, lots of pockets",4
"I wound up laminating these individually, as I didn't think the peel-and would be durable for the whole year, especially since I am looking to save these to use again in future years. LOVE the pictures and overall visual aspect of the cards, but I noticed the print quality on some was noticeably grainy. Luckily, I plan to have these up high on the wall, so from a distance the graininess isn't significantly noticeable. Overall pleased with my purchase though.",4
"This fall I started attending a mom's group at a local church and one day, they were giving away ""Jesus Calling"" by Sarah Young. I didn't get one that day but I wanted it anyway and ordered it. I actually ended up buying this calendar version instead of the book by accident but decided to keep it since I already had it.

Sarah Young and her husband are missionaries who have spent time overseas teaching others about Jesus and his love for us all. During this time, she started to journal her thoughts and words that she heard Jesus speak to her as well as Scripture verses that spoke to her. She ended up turning those writings into ""Jesus Calling,"" a daily devotion that we can all read to feel peaceful when we need it most.

This daily calendar contains a couple paragraphs for each day that take about a minute to read as well as some Scripture verses at the bottom so you can read them in your Bible. Unless otherwise indicated, the verses are taken from the New International Version of the Holy Bible. This flip calendar measures about 5 1/4 inches by 4 1/4 inches by 1 1/4 inches. January 1st through June 30th are on one side of the pages (including February 29th) and July 1st through December 31st are on the backs of those pages. They are spiral-bound at the top and this calendar has an easel so it can stand on its own. The pages are made with paper much like a paperback book.

I love the devotions because no matter if I'm having a good or bad day, they are exactly what I need to hear and they help me achieve a sense of calm and peace. At first, I liked this flip calendar but I personally prefer the hardcover version so I ended up purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-Calling-Enjoying-Peace-in-His-Presence/dp/1591451884/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence</a>&nbsp;as well. I compared the two versions and the print in the hardcover one is ever so slightly larger and contains an introduction that I really enjoyed reading. I'm planning to give this flip calendar version to my mom so at least it will get used but this would still be great for anyone who wants one on their desk at work, nightstand, or any location where they spend enough time to read these devotions.

Overall, I love these devotions but prefer the hardcover version more. I still feel this calendar would be a great gift for anyone who likes the flip calendar versions and is interested in a daily devotional. I loved ""Jesus Calling"" so much that I also purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-Always-Embracing-Joy-in-His-Presence/dp/0718039505/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus Always: Embracing Joy in His Presence</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-Today-Experience-Hope-Through-His-Presence/dp/1400320097/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus Today: Experience Hope Through His Presence</a>&nbsp;and recommend those as well!",4
It's a great motivator to start the day.  I wish there was room to put the actual scripture on the page.,4
"Not really what I was expecting, but is nice. My only problem is the print is very small, hubby has to pick it up off the desk to read it. A desk calendar should be able to be read while it is still on the desk, and he has good vision.",4
Good book,4
"Good intro to geography and mapping. It is targeted for K-2 and I felt that the level of difficulty varied widely from page to page. I skipped several pages at a time in a few sections, but plan to pick them up at the end of the year. Over all, a fun intro to maps, etc.

I did not find it to be a hindrance to make copies of the pages where you need both front and back for the cutting/gluing activities. On the one hand, its nice to have a reproducible page, on the other hand, it would be really easy for the publisher to just print those pages separately-not front to back.",4
"This book will be part of our homeschool Kindergarten curriculum next year. Without wanting to guild the lily by buying a huge curriculum given our concentration on reading and math in Kindergarten, I did need a little bit of a framework to use as a jumping off point for our geography studies next year. This book will do just that. It is laid out in a systematic manner with lots of activities and ideas, but will also let the user add and expand upon the ideas without interfering to much. Very pleased.",4
"The concepts in this book are clearly presented, in an easy-to-understand (for a child) format, with each activity being directly related to the concept being taught.  The pictures are clear (black and white drawings) and relative to each lesson.  Instructions are simple and easy to comprehend for a young child.

The only issue with this book (and many others that try to span multiple grade levels) is that the information advances too quickly. I suppose if one completed a single page each month for the span of K-2 it would be perfect, but the activities sutable for a kindergartener would certainly be boring for a second grader.

The book works well for my family as we modify activities and have multiple grade levels learning from the same book.  I would recomend the book, but suggest that it not be used as the single source of geography education for your child unless you only plan to use it once in a while.",4
"cute, works well with 2nd graders. The art is somewhat generic and cheap, but in general they do the job.",4
"These charts work well in giving my daughter incentive to be a better listener. Once the chart is completed, I let her take one toy from her treasure box. However, it will work better with older kids since there are just too many stickers for little toddlers to earn to complete the chart.",4
These are really cute ocean cut outs. Originally bought these for an ocean themed baby shower where I invited guests to write well wishes and new parenting tips on the back of the card for the expecting parents. The cards are good quality print on them but not very thick card stock. Unfortunately I didn't get these cards in time so I can to get some from Michaels instead where it was a thicker card stock and worked even better.,4
"nice and large, bright colors good for a classroom",4
Item was as expected. Colors are vibrant. Happy with my purchase. Shipping was quick!,4
Cute colorful border.,4
okay,4
"I thought it was odd that I had to cut apart the numbers.  Other than that, it's well made.",4
Thanx very nice,4
Product seems to be in good quality it will make a great addition to my daycare.,4
"I needed a replacement for my classroom for my card chart for discipline. Looks nice, the stitching between the pockets is my only worry.",4
"I am giving it only four stars because I wish it had another row of pockets instead of sharing two cards for extra days (30 and 31). I didn't realize there were cards that share dates for months that start at the tail end of the first week or I wouldn't have bought it. I am using it to start teaching months and days to my two and a half year old, so having those cards sharing dates for some months is confusing. Other than that all of the graphics are super cute and I like the quality.",4
Great calendar!! I love it. Can't wait to use it in my classroom. The months and holidays cards are cute and great quality.,4
Great calendar! Easily customizable with our own printouts too!,4
"My kids love being able to re do the calendar each month and inserting any holiday and birthday cards. I laminated mine so that it would last longer, especially with kids helping and handling them",4
I found this at a local teacher store for double the price and thought it was too much so when I found it on amazon I was happy it looks just like the picture and has all holidays or important days needed the material isn't cheap and the pictures are colorful it arrived quickly and looks just like the picture.,4
These are so cute but won't be using them til Spring.  They do bring a smile when you look at them.  Great Christmas stocking stuffer for any kids or adults that love stickers.,4
"Simple to use. It fits into my bag. Also, I like the cover better than the blue or burgandy old books",4
"This roll of self-sticking wall paper in a large chevron pattern is pretty nice, especially for apartment dwellers like me. The roll is fairly large  I didn't do a large area, just part of one wall  but you get around 16 feet of paper thats roughly 20 inches wide.

I have plaster walls that are somewhat uneven in places. Even so, I had success with this. You will need a squeegee of some sort to help with the application but you can also peel up and restick if you have to. Go slowly and measure before so that you can match the chevrons.

When I leave the apartment or get tired of it, I can easily remove it.

Very nice. Recommend.",4

"Quality velvet hangers. (I would've given the item 5 stars, but 2 of the metal hanging part out of the 50, popped out of the top).",4
Much better than the steel ones. But glue the bottoms of the end inserts into the base.,4
The handle was a little wobbly sometimes but it is just the right size for travel and just powerful enough. It is good to have the focused head so you have some control blowing your hair. I first used this at my friend's home and liked it so much I ordered right from her house.,4
"I picked one of these up on the recommendation of a family member.  I carry a a bunch of keys for work and have a total of 12 keys on my keysmart (including my 2 house keys).  I also added a Kingston thumb drive (which is handy to have just in case, but I may remove it since I so rarely use it).  I ordered my key smart with the extension kit (this item alone will not accommodate all of my keys).

The biggest concern I have about this is that it looks like a pocket knife/multi-tool.  While this shouldn't be an issue, the fact is, I work in an airport and will travel to other airports from time to time.  I don't want to be carrying anything that is going to be considered suspicous.  That being said, nobody has said anything to me when I do carry it and use it even post security in the airport.  In the 2 weeks since I got this, I have been though 6 airports security lines and not once has it been flagged for additional screening.

It does take a little longer to fish out the key you need, but I don't access my keys all too often and I know which keys are which (even though many of them are the same shape and size).  If you do need to constantly be pulling out keys, this could become inconvenient, especially if you have the screws really tight.

People ask me about this all the time and comment on what a great idea it is.  I definitely find it handy and don't anticipate going back to a traditional key ring any time soon!",4
Nice desk calendar.  Attractive artwork,4

This one has some great features and a couple of minor quirks.

It's real wax over a plastic base. That's good. It looks more realistic and feels like wax. Because it is. The remote control is good quality with plenty of features: brightness, timer, on and flicker. Flicker is terrible - it's not random at all - just dim, dimmer, bright. Repeat. Always on is better - the flicker from the ""flame"" looks a lot more natural.  The brightness has several settings. About mid way looks the most natural - and is where I shot the video.

I also think the flame ""flicker"" / motion tends to be a little extreme.  It looks good at a distance, but artificial close-up.  The candle uses 3 AAA batteries. I shot the video with flicker/candle mode off (""light"" mode.)

Overall it looks really good, and is ideal for locations where a real candle is not practical or safe.  Between shelves, on counters below cabinets, and so on.

Free sample provided for honest review.",4
ok,4
I use the timer to alert me when something is done cooking. I use the other to remind me towel around every 1/2 hr. when reading or watching TV.,4
"These are very pretty for added embellishments on cards or tags. Since they have so many colors, they are easily matched to any cardstock you may have on hand, and the icons are very detailed and realistic. I really love Susan Winget products and these are no exception.",4
"I bought one of these for 2016 and loved it.  The 2017 version has thinner paper.  I still like the calendar and the vintage pics, but I wish the paper were thicker.  You can actually see a little bit through each sheet so that the colors on the paper underneath show through.",4
It is an interest mix.,4
like the old fashioned Johnson and johnsons,4
I received this as a wedding gift and i've been using it for over 5 years. I love it!,4
not like the originals but still like them,4
"Useful item .... again, really like all the Joie products.  Most time our wine is used up and the stopper is only used between fill-ups.  It's cute and well made.",4
If you have a craft project these are useful. Remember to use a small nail to make the guide hole!,4
GOOD,4
"Only improvement would be the Le Creuset stoneware was made in France like their enameled cast iron. It is a nice dish, and bakes well. But the price point is a bit high for where it is produced. I do want to add that the sellar shipped quickly and the dish was very well protected.",4
as expected,4
"All these reviews are correct. They are in fact adorable. I must've been the only customer that received a pepper & pepper shaker (they both have the brown around the eyes). I don't eat salt/pepper much, but.....it's always a 50/50 chance I'll get it right.",4
"This pitcher is almost perfect.  One thing they could change for the better is making the tip of the pour spout stay open while you are pouring from it.  Tends to flop down and impede the liquid coming out smoothly.  Fits great on the fridge shelf.  A little hard to prop on the spines in my Maytag dishwasher, but I feel perfect size and shape is an equal trade-off.",4
good body wash for the price,4
"No bells and whistles, just a very good basic shower head. Over the years I have had all kinds and types of shower heads and hand held units, pulsators, massagers, etc., etc.. I found myself needing a replacement and decided to go back to a basic full spray model, with a good name brand. For a small dimension head (approximately 2.5"" diameter) this Moen provides very good spray with even water coverage and the direction of the head can be adjusted. Installation was very quick and easy, just a little teflon tape and an adjustable wrench. It's lightweight though the specs state it is manufactured of metal (along with the finish and non-metallic face). The brushed nickel finish looks great. If you are looking for a basic full even spray for your shower, I recommend this Moen 6300-BC.",4
Nice to apply to crafts,4
These are really cute plates.  I just thought that they would be bigger than dessert plates.  Just heads up to anyone looking for dinner plates.,4
"Lihom mini rice cooker is a simple space saver (for those of us with limited real estate on our counters). It perfectly cooks rice without any fuss or frills. I just wish there was a space spoken for the rice scooper on the rice cooker like other models. Aside from that small inconvenience, it's a great value for the price. It's also a cute little rice cooker for those of us that are suckers for such design. Handy for travels too!",4
"Smaller that I had expected, but my own fault for not reading the description. A great gift for you girl friends or yourself, all scents are great without being overpowering.",4
"Haven't used yet, but it will do when I want to use it.",4
"Adorable.  Quite small, and you won't be able to fill a lifetime's worth of files in here, but for the minimalist organizer or something sweet to go beneath of or on top of a desk, you'll be quite pleased.  It's extremely sturdy, however I docked a star for this:  the bottom is just a thin plastic sort of fabric, and if you added a lot of hefty papers to this, I could see the bottom becoming loose and eventually ripping if you needed to lift it a lot.  So keep it on a surface if you intend on buying this.",4
"Towels are sturdy and handsome.  Cookie cutter, although sturdy, doesn't look much like a fish and cookies made with it don't look at all like fish since they spread a bit.  I was looking for a fish-shaped cookie cutter when I purchased this set so I was disappointed, but I love the towels hence the 4-star rating.  They were also attractively packaged together and arrived quickly.",4
"I have several Wusthof Classic utility knives in the 4.5"" to 6"" size. This is my favorite. I like the fully serrated style. The serrations are deep like on a bread knife. Years ago I had an Ecko ""sandwich knife"" like this, but lost it. This is the first good replacement I've found.",4
I love all Philosophy shower gels.  They're scents always smell like the real deal.  The later is so rich and creamy.  Its a delight to use in the shower.,4
Pricey but more substantial than others.  Does the job.,4
"It shouldn't cost a premium to get lids of a different color for these common Rubbermaid containers.  But I keep getting my containers mixed up with other folks' containers at work, so for me it was worth it to get the pretty blue colored lids.  I have tried labels, but they look so awful after a couple washings I hate using them.
I would have given it 5 stars if the price hadn't been so high. I'm guessing it doesn't cost them that much more to change the color of the plastic used to made the lids!",4
"I was looking for an alternative to plastic to heat water for tea in the microwave.  This cute little pitcher will hold enough water for two 10 oz glasses of tea.  I heat the water in the pitcher, drop in a tea ball for 5 minutes, and have tea for the day.  I only drink iced tea so I make the tea early so it can cool down by the afternoon.  I gave the pitcher 4 stars because the handle gets hot.  I leave the pitcher out on the counter and the black dots are quite perky and match the black on my other appliances.  I like this pitcher a lot.",4
"I'd tried this shampoo a couple of years ago while away on vacation.  I recalled that I liked it then and loved the scent...only problem was that I couldn't remember the actual name of it later when I returned home.  I occasionally did a half-hearted search for it in our local stores, but with no luck.  I did remember that grapefruit was part of the scent; so recently I did an online search for grapefruit-scented shampoos and recognized the bottle.  Then I was even happier to find it available on Amazon.  The grapefruit and ginger scent is just as nice as I remembered.  My hair is blonde with lighter salon-added highlights so it needs a shampoo that protects the color.  This shampoo is great for chemically treated hair and leaves my hair with a wonderful shine.  While it doesn't produce quite as much lather as some of my other shampoos, it makes enough to get the job done and rinses well.

Other things that I like about it is that it is cruelty-free (no animal testing), sulfate-free, PH balanced, mostly organic, and made in the USA.  Another reviewer gave it low marks because it was felt to be misleading regarding the sulfate-free claim.  I certainly don't claim to be a chemist; but everything I've investigated says that the surfactant used in this shampoo has a significant enough difference from ""sodium laureth sulfate"" that companies are allowed to use the sulfate-free claim.  ""Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate"" (which IS in this shampoo) is a sulfate derivative that's more gentle than actual sulfates.  It's my understanding that most (if not all) shampoos have to use some sort of surfactant which is what does most of the cleaning/conditioning of the hair.  So, I personally feel fine about it.

For those who like to know just what all ingredients are in the products they use, the listing is as follows:

"The ShuiMiFang thermos - provided by vendor as a 'for review' item - is clearly meant to be a high end, high quality item. It comes inside a 'gift quality' box, beautifully presented. The simple, almost industrial design makes it an elegant accessory. The outside finish is flawless and the interior wall appears to be white porcelain.

It could be used to store hot or cold beverages, perhaps tea or coffee but one must be aware that some care is required for the thermos to stay beautiful and elegant. I wouldn't, for example, use it as a travel bring along item because it could be easily scratched but it would be an eye catcher and possibly a conversation starter at a mass cultural or possibly sports event. Lacking its own protective bag or case, one must do whatever it takes to preserve its integrity and finish and, of course, to properly clean it on the inside if used with contents such as tea or coffee that may stain the white porcelain.

One star is deducted because of the missing protective bag or case but the remaining 4 stars are well earned for a thing of exquisite beauty.",4
"Hi - i am actually writing this review because i got back into trying to achieve the perfect shot -  i do agree that its messy - and the static - i never paid too much attention to that - but it is messy - has some static and loud -  but i do have to say that i had mines for 11 years !!  i never done anything to it - which maybe was a reason for my espresso grinds not working out correctly -  i finally opened it up - just top part - and it was full of dried up oily beans etc, -  i did a good cleaning - put it back -  and then filled the hopper with white rice - any cheap kind - will be fine -  ran it thru -  it cleaned it up nicely -  be sure to run some beans after and throw them out - some rice will be still in there -  but have to say its held up very nice - well worth the price i paid -

i usually find i have to keep mines on the lowest grind setting which is 0 - to get a fine enough grind - some machines - may choke on a very fine grind -  but if i go less fine -  the shot will not come out as good - too weak for my taste -  beans also make a difference - some need it finer - some maybe you can back off a bit -

now i am back in the market for a new setup - they are many new models out now and i won't purchase this again just for the fact i like different features now etc, -  but for your avg. user - not getting too involved - it did and still does work -  many others today which i think will work better - look nicer -

looking into the lelit brand -  model 43 - doser less -  decent price - small compact unit -  i am sure after 11 years of not doing any cleaning till now -  must has some affect on the grind outcome -  cant say till i compare to new grinder if its a big difference or not -",4
"My Amcor portable ac died 2 weeks ago, so I ordered this one after reading reviews on many different brands. This was the best priced for the features & I had owned a Haier window ac that I absolutely LOVED. We have been having a cool snap of weather so, I haven't been able to fully test it. The installation was easy since I already had a board cut the size of my window- it's a casement window & the kit supplied won't work in casement windows. I panicked when I first plugged it in and there was nothing lighting up,-after 3 pushes on the reset button on the cord, finally a pretty blue light came on indicating it had electricity- a good start, I pressed cool & freezing cold air came out right away. I haven't had any days over 75 degrees yet, so-I'm hoping it works as well as the one I bought it to replace. My amcor, cooled 3 HUGE connected rooms- living room 17x15 dinning room 15x15 & kitchen 12x10, 2 of which have a huge cathedral cieling! One plus I noticed right away- It is TWICE as quiet as my Amcor was.
Reasons I didn't give 5 stars-
1)It seems like I'm going to have to be emptying water if I use the dehumidify function :/
I can't do that- I have a bad back & the sales pitch description said it ""evaporated"" the water out. My amcor never needed draining in the 4 years I had it & I MOSTLY used it in dehumidify! So, I'm not going to be a happy camper if I have to drain this monstrosity. The units instructions say the unit WILL shut off if the water tank is full OR if it is a humid day!!!!- it better not freakin shut off on a humid day- that's WHY I need an AC duh! I'm not paying $350.00 for a fan!
2) It is HUGE, takes up twice as big as a footprint as the Amcor did. :/
3) There is only ONE filter- I hope this doesn't mean there will be problems :/ my Amcor had 4 filters & the option of putting charcoal filters inbetween to filter your room's air if you wanted.

I don't know why these type of ACs only last 1 to 4 years? I live in the NORTHEAST, up till THIS year we rarely had temps over 90, until now- with all the global warming & solar flar activity! They only get used 3 to 4 months MAX per year! and I shut them off at night 90% of the time! So, they aren't even running round the clock! So, even the one that lasted 4 years ACTUALLY only lasted one measly year- if you add up the actual time it was used!!!
I remember having an Amana window unit last me 15 years! & I lived in the same area, used it the same way.
Seems like the more technologically advanced we get the shorter the appliances last-",4
"I've had this skillet for 4 months, and it is growing on me. I typically cook using cast iron or steel skillets.

If you have an induction range, (e.g., I have the Viking Induction) note that the skillet does not contain much inductive material, and it heats considerably slower than carbon steel or cast iron. On the other hand, that is convenient because you do not want to accidentally ruin a nonstick finish by overheating the pan.

There are two design shortcomings. First, the sides of the skillet are too vertical. It is not possible to ""toss"" well while sauteing. If you only ""stir"" this is not a problem. It would be better with more angled sides. The second shortcoming is that the handle has a small, awkward loop, which is hard to hang on a pot hook with any other pans.

The strengths are that the skillet is solid and well-built. The nonstick finish is well attached, and looks like new after four months. The nonstick finish is slightly textured which helps distribute oil.

Note a cover is not included. If you want one, you will need the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/J-A-Henckels-International-Classic-Clad-26-Centimeter-Lid/dp/B000CSCNKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">J.A.

"Pros:
- No off taste that you would get with stainless steel or plastic.
- Highly aesthetically pleasing.
- Nice cork top.
- Super sturdy construction; nice thick glass.

Cons:
- Washing the inside is a pain.
- On the Flaska website, one of its selling points is ""water restructuring"" which is not scientifically sound.

Overall, I recommend it and I'd buy it again.",4
"Water stays super cold in this container.  In my experience, the type of lid used makes a difference on how long it stays cold.  The wide mouth flat lid is best to keep water cold.  The straw mouth is good.  The flip lid does the poorest job at keeping drinks cold.

My daughter (7) and son (5) each have a hydro flask for school.  One is pink and one is white.  My daughter is pretty good about keeping things in shape.  My son is careless.  Anyway, each of their bottles have chips in them after about 3 months of use.  The chips are along the bottom of the hydro flask.  It looks like the paint or outer coating has come off.  The flask is still functional though, so they still use it.

I also have a black 64 oz hydro flask.  Mine has no chips on it.",4
"This credit-card-sized motivational bottle opener is great for on the go situations.  Personally I do not put it in my wallet, as it is a little on the heavy side and I like to keep my wallet minimalist.  But it is a perfect fit for my zippered pouch in my purse.  The fum graphics remind me not to forget about working out (rarely do I need to be reminded to sleep and eat).  I received a sample of this product (either free or at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.",4
cute,4
Nice little calendar.,4
It is a gift.,4
"This is a nice pen, I like the size and weight, it's well constructed and the multi-use function is superb. Unfortunately, I never really got comfortable with the pen 0.5 not the smoothness writing tool.",4
"We get a lot of guests so we give up the kids room and they use this in our Master.  It's comfy and easy to use.  The pillow is crap though, not enough to keep a restful head comfy.",4
"-Nice size
-Good solid glass and seems consistently, solidly made
-Does feel a bit chunky and cheap in the hand - but probably an advantage for more durability!
Recommended!",4
"Fits in my bike water bottle carrier perfectly!  I just froze water in half the bottle without any problem; it has a pressure relief valve in the lid so the bottle doesn't break!  I like the cool blue color as well (it comes in other colors).

This could have received a 5 star or a 4 star rating.  If it was insulated I would have given it a 5 star rating.  I guess one can't have everything! ----",4
"When I first received these cups, I was thrilled.  The design is exquisite. They appeared to be a very high quality product...until I noticed that part of the design is chipping off the outside of one of the cups, just a month or two after purchase.  Keep in mind that I have treated these cups carefully, washed by hand, and air dried.  Royal Albert is a WONDERFUL brand.  Too bad about these cups.  I really like them, but they aren't up to standard.",4
"I am mostly very happy with this recipe keeper....it is replacing the one I had since 1981!....they thought of just about everything. But if you have enough recipes and need to put some that are less used or need to try yet into the pocket in the back, the book will not close all the way so that the magnetic strips catch each other. They just need to make the thinner one on the bottom wider and it would. But it is not a big problem. It flips easily and it was very easy to work with, well constructed. Personally, I think twenty dollars would be a better price as it is afterall just a cardboard cover but it does have all the things you need.",4
"Excellent knives - takes serving a nice cut of meat to a new level.  Not just a flimsy steak knife with a better handle.  It is a well made product. The wood block is fantastic also.

The only issue with this product i have, is after years of use one of my knife tips did break - trying to send it back for a replacement blade feels like such a hassle.  Send money, self addressed stamped mailing label and the knife in a protective package back.... you will get your new knife or a reason why it can't be fixed back.... at some point.  Rather than have the knife go missing, I just haven't sent it back.... feels like to much of a hassle.

Kershaw though does make great products, and has a great warranty... getting the benefits of said warranty is where I see a fault.",4
"There wan't as much paper as I expected, but the covers were very cool. Not sure the price is a value unless the theme of the covers is really what you're looking for.",4
This is a great fruit/vegetable knife for me. The styling is great and the handle fits my large hands well. Its not to heavy to do precision cutting and slicing and not too light when working with tough skinned fruits and veggies. The one piece construction adds confidence too.,4
"Pros:
1.  Wide mouth is perfect for stews and other soups
2.  Really does keep my lunch soups suprisingly hot until noon after a 5:30 am fill

Cons:
1.  The top has too many pieces (5;  cover cup, inner cup, coffee screw-on stopper, main screw-on top & a removable poly seal)
2.  The top has crevices that trap liquid & food particles and must be disassembled to get it clean",4
Finally figured that the entire banned area on top would also come off.  Did the job for what I needed it to do.,4
"This is a very nice and decently made faux leather folio.  The pad of paper is of good heavy weight quality. Holding up well as I put mu gear through a lot being an engineer. This gets thrown in a backpack daily to protect papers between different site and it does this well. The pen holder is big enough for nicer writing tools and seems sturdy.

All in all a high end plastic portfolio.",4
"This toaster is so cute!  I chose the lime green - even the electrical cord is lime green!  I lowered the rating to 4-stars because even on the highest setting, the bread barely turns a light tan color. This toaster has extra features that many toasters don't have: a rack for warming buns, a reheat button, defrost function and a cancel button.",4
"Just don't freeze stuff in them, they'll warp.  Otherwise, they are pretty nice.

They have a single layer though, so don't expect them to keep anything warm or cool",4
"These are really nice for headaches.  I love to plaster one on my forehead anytime I get a headache.  They're not sticky enough to be able to wonder around with them on, but lets face it with a headache bad enough to warrant a cold patch who wants to be up running around?  If you want to use a second one after the first one looses it's oomph you'll want to wash your forehead with soap and water between them to insure the second one sticks well.",4
"I love the way it looks (I chose a green one)... even the CORD is green, neat touch. The controls are a bit spread out, with a ""bun warming"" tray dial on one end, the actual how-dark-do-you-want-it controls on the side and the elevator lever on the other narrow end. I buy bread at the market, and it's SLIGHTLY wider than a Wonder Bread type of slice, and it's a tight fit in this thing.

And now, the main problem: it doesn't exactly TOAST all that well, you know? It seems timid. Good for people (like my kids!) who don't like toast with much color on it. This thing has a defrost setting and a ""re-toast"" setting, maybe for people who want their toast a bit darker... you send toast through a second time for a little boost.

Overall... it sure is cute! It could be a bit larger and a lot more aggressive when it comes to toasting stuff.",4
"It's pleasant organic coffee. I had a bad experience ordering this coffee from Costco once,
and I had to return it back to the store(but,it might be that the batch was out of normal
quality since the aftertaste was too sour).Later on,I decided to order it through Amazon.
I'm satisfied with this coffee. It's good thought I don't find the strong chocolaty taste in
it. It tastes fine. It's a low acidity coffee with an adequate caffeine effect
(not overpowering)even in the espresso brew. The only thing I find to be heavily inconsistent
is the permanent price aggregation over time,so you can't count on a stable price subscribing
to ""Subscribe and Save"" automation delivery. But,nowadays,it seems to be the case for
all Organic Camano Island Coffee types.",4
"I ordered a 12, 14 and 16"" spoon.  They are well made and very nice, but BIG.  One more size up, and I could use it as a paddle.  Makes our home cookware look like toys (Cuisinart Pro).",4
"I ordered 2 carafes about a month before Thanksgiving with the intention of using them at my Thanksgiving party.  About 2 weeks later, I received a huge box with only one carafe inside.  I'll review first the carafe and then the seller, Chefs.

The carafe is lovely, sturdy and functional, all you'd ever want in a carafe.  I give the carafe 5 stars easily, though I deducted a star for the seller.

My problem came in dealing with Chefs, the seller.  When I was shorted a carafe, I called Chefs to explain they'd made an error.  No big deal, we all make mistakes.  But the CSR did a horrible job in dealing with his company's mistake.  At first, he refused to believe me.  I asked to speak to his manager.  He put me on hold for a good 5 minutes, then told me his manager wasn't available.  So, I asked for the manager's voice mail, since the CSR was being difficult.  All of a sudden, the CSR believed me and told me he'd ship me another carafe immediately.  I finally received it about 3 weeks later and missing the event I'd ordered it for.

The carafe is worth every penny, but I'd really think twice about dealing with the company that sells it.",4
"I was very pleased with this portfolio. It fits all my stuff nicely. Everyone that sees it calls it a briefcase and says it's really nice. I put some file folders in the left pocket and I'm super organized now. The only problems I have with it it there's nowhere to attach a shoulder strap or zipper pulls. If it had those, it would be perfect.",4
I enjoy this new colander most of all because it fits in the dishwasher so much easier than traditional colanders.  It can be washed while folded and that makes a big difference when loading dishes after a big meal.  It also stores easily and opens easily with the flick of one hand.  It fits well in my saucepans and allows pasta and other items to drain into their pan or a bowl if you want to collect juice.  It is very comforting to know that the silicon will not melt during use no matter how hot the items are in it or that it rests on.  I wish I had had this long ago.,4
"The Shun Steel series is identical to the Classic series, but with a steel handle. As such, this is a fantastic knife. The Steel line is being discontinued, so they are some of the best buys on the market at cut-rate prices. Certainly the best buys from a non-specialty store.

Just be aware that the D-shape handle is designed for right-handed people only. Similarly, like most Japanese knives, the blade is ground with a right-handed bias. Shun also sells a left-handed version, but this is not it. Amazon should note that in the description.",4
"If you have the older R & B flatware that looks like this and can't find more of it, go ahead and buy this.  It doesn't quite match as it is much lighter in weight, but you can still set a consistent-looking table.",4
"These are okay loaf pans. But they just felt a little bit flimsy, and I like sturdy bake ware that will last forever. So, I exchanged them for the Chicago Metallic Loaf Pans.",4
"I bought it as a birthday gift for my mother (70 years old).
She enjoys this daily by putting celery, apple, grapes, pineapple, carrot, and other healthy vegetables and fruits into the blender and what results are smooth, creamy wonderful juices that will please your taste buds every time.
if you spend a lot of money in Jumbajuice or other juice bars, buy this without any hesitation.  It will save you money in just a couple of months and will make you healthier in no time.",4
Beautiful,4
"Pros
  Nice paper
  Nice banded columns to write on
  Nice, classy cover design

Pros
  Cover could be thicker as 17 months in my purse it will probably get destroyed
  Cover already showing signs of wear after a few weeks
  50-50 on ordering again",4
My son really likes this set of silverware. He was super excited to get it. It's perfect for toddlers. My son will be 3 next month and had no problem using the spoon and forks. I put the knifes up because he's too young to use a knife. I love the colors! I also like how thick they are yet how light they are. They are also very easy to clean! I really like them!,4
Love the stand up desk style.  Wish the calendar was a little larger.,4
"Got these on a deal for my girlfriend who is a chef, she said the bags were cheap but the rest was a nice set to replace her more expensive ones for now.",4
I had a set previously and they were great.,4
"I wasn't too sure at first when I received this item if I would like it or not. At first it seemed a little flimsy, and that it may not hold up. I have used it once and so far it has been fine. I still am not 100% sure how it will hold up after continuous use, or by someone who uses it daily.

It was easy to use, my son helped me make mash potatoes and he was able to use it just fine. It is made out of stainless steel which is another feature that I liked about it, but it isn't the strongest stainless steel. It doesn't seem heavy duty as it is advertised to be.

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I gave this item a 4 out of 5 rating because of the flimsy feeling with the product. If the product breaks or holds up for an extended period I will update this review.",4
great bags easy to use,4
it helps stop the itch,4
"This is a really neat stencil that I use with my dylusion sprays. The only thing I did not like about this is that when I opened it, the plastic in one part snapped right away. It's not very strong. This worries me because it will need to be washed and wiped down but too much pressure and it snaps. I can still use it but I might skip on buying this brand until they come out with something stronger that won't break after the first use.",4
"This whisk works better than the metal ones from the grocery gadget section.  It is far more hygenic too.  The plastic whip portion doesn't beat up glass dishes.  However, on the downside, the weight of the handle takes a little getting used to.  It IS heavier than the cheaper version and ""got away from me"" on the first few uses, leaving quite a mess of whips eggs goo on counter.  Just an FYI :)",4
Works great on a tile floor with office furniture.  Put on the bottoms of furniture so I can move them much easier when needed without worrying about the flooring.,4
"Good quality.  Takes a quick vegetable oil spray immediately before scooping in the muffin batter without wilting.  Only thing is you do need to separate them and depending upon the humidity in your area (our's is nearly 100 on many days), the cups will stick together so you have concentrate and separate them as you go.",4
Product as described,4
Very nice detailed stamp with a hint of mystery. Can be used by crafters or mixed media artists. I would recommend this item to others.,4
"good product but way overpriced, u can get it from walmart for 4.50 so the mark up is high, but product works",4
"This pad fit my humidifier very well.  I will warn you, I was tempted to buy one of the 10x13.5"" filters just by visual inspection, so be sure to measure your existing pad before you order (the owners manual does not have any measurements in it because they want you to buy it for a ridiculous price from your HVAC dealer)!  I measured the item before ordering it and had no issues.  It is about 1/4"" larger than what I measured (which is as described), but that is to allow the notches in the filter housing to hold the filter in place.  Despite not being mentioned, this is an aluminum pad which should last for about two heating seasons.  To replace the pad, just open the door on your humidifier, slide out and dispose of the old one and replace it with the new one.  I will update this review if I have any issues.  The seller shipped very fast as well.  Good experience overall.",4
"This is clearly a great quality spoon. Also very easy to clean. It's a nice change from wooden spoons because it seems more sanitary (I've heard wood absorbs bacteria).

My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that the handle could be longer. It's not a short spoon, per se, but for this much money, I'd expect a longer handle. Otherwise, good!",4
"I have one of these under my desk in my office.  It blows up at me and doesn't mess up the papers on my desk.  On the low setting, it isn't too loud, but the high settings are quite loud.  I wish it has a super low setting, but it doesn't.  Knob on the back adjusts off-hi-med-lo and a button on top adjusts rotation.  It can also be angled up and down.  Mine has been in use of a couple of years without any problem, so it stands up well to heavy use.",4

This fan works good; but some times in the summer I had wanted more wind power. In the summer time I used it night and day. It worked well. I still use it some times in the fall after I come home from a walk to cool off.,4
"We homeschool, and I bought this to switch out our daily schedule cards which list the topics we'll be covering for the day. This year, we're doing Kindergarten and a short pocket chart was sufficient for our needs ""Science"", ""Stories, ""Numbers"". But thinking ahead to next year and years from now, I think I should have purchased the regular-sized pocket chart for when we need to list more topics. Also, I made up chore cards with pictures of ways the kids can help out around the house. I think this pocket chart will be the perfect way to display them, so I'll be happy to keep it for that purpose once we outgrow it as a schedule holder.",4
It was a great price.  It's organized beautifully.  The only complaint I would have is that the font is too small.,4
good deal,4
Cute,4
"My 4-year-old daughter loves this.
The notepad is just big enough to have her write things (she has a big handwriting), compared to my post-it notes.",4
Going to laminate so that I can reuse it year after year.,4
Functional,4
GREAT FOR LEARNING,4
Bought this for our 5 & 6 year old. Use the blue tack to stick to the walls however the roll in it makes it difficult to keep flat on the wall. Does what it is intended to do. Made from fairly durable materials and should hold up for years to come.,4
This is a Christmas Gift for a friend who Loves Maxine!!!,4
Exactly as describes and shipped fast.,4
A handy tool.,4
"It's attractive and sized right for me. It would have been perfect if it had a ribbon bookmark and a plastic sleeve cover where I could store reminders, but I added those.",4
Gift,4
"It's fine, but would be better with categories, prompts, scripture in it, just has empty pages",4
"The Footprints prayer journal was given to our adult daughter to use for the coming year. It isn't quite like the journal we both had the previous year, but it seems adequate for the way she wanted to use it. I gave this four stars since she hasn't mentioned how she likes it.",4
"I love this journal! The hard cover is sturdy and glossy which is go beautiful! This picture here does it no justice! The only thing I don't like is the way the lines are ruled on the pages. They are a bit on the wide ruled side, which I'm not a fan of. I find myself using more pages than I normally would to write what I need, which means I'll be finished with this soon, which I'm not too happy about. But I LOVE THIS JOURNAL SO MUCH!",4
I have purchased many journals to give as gifts.  I decided to use this one for myself in recording my favorite memories with my grandchildren.  The cover is beautiful.  I love using this and love the size.  I would have given it a 5 but several of my pens caused the pages to bleed through to the other side of the page.  My recommendation is to use a gel pen or gel marker.  I would buy again knowing which pens to use.  Gorgeous color reminding me of the names of Jesus.,4
This journal was nice. Materials seemed of good quality. Solid build. I think the quality to price ratio is perfect. This was meant to be a gift and I was not disappointed.,4
Attractive and a decent number of pages.  It is really a reasonable price for something so special.,4
"Good value.  I like to use this for keeping notes on sermons and other readings, thoughts I have.  The size is handy for carrying along with my Bible and just generally keeping around the house.  Will order some more.",4
"I love this set of books for the fact that it is so easy for the child to learn using the simple step-by-step instructions in these books. What impressed me the most was that my son actually looked forward to using this book. That doesn't happen very often with anything related to school. I thought it was nice that in the beginning of the book they teach them some pre-writing skills to get them adjusted to writing in cursive without it feeling too intimidating. Great series, perfect for the child who is just learning the art.",4
I LIKED  IT,4
The product itself is amazing. I love the HWT program and believe it helps children tremendously. The price is higher then it should be as on the HWT website each book is less then $10.00 and I paid double that. The seller is unfair in his pricing however the books are worth every penny I overpaid.,4
"My wife and I bought our very first camper. We're in our 50's and the kids are (finally) gone.

This is one of those books with a place to write down your thoughts about different camping areas. It has a place for pictures, recipes, people you met, and other stuff. It's about 2 pages, 7""x 8'' with a 4'' x 8'' picture area and the rest has questions and blanks.

Cover is cute and yellow is the wife's favorite.....there are many like this....I don't know if I would buy it again or a different one...",4
"I bought another mom's calendar for myself and then found it didn't have a pocket.  So I checked that this one did and got it for my daughter.  I suggested she get one last year and she scoffed at the idea, saying she and her husband can keep track of everything (including twin boys, two cats, etc) on their mobile phone calendars.  Well, after one appointment card went missing and the clinic said they didn't have them on their appointment schedule, I think it's time to go back to a paper calendar.  I think she will find this very useful to keep track of everything.",4
"This has been my family calendar for years and years. Every year I look for something else, and every year I end up ordering this one again.

To be brutally honest, I hate the cutesy family artwork and have even contacted More Time Moms asking for it in other designs.  Even a plain black-and-white edition or simple seasonal color schemes would be perfect!

Note that this calendar uses extra space for recipes, activity suggestions, etc..  To some this may be a nice touch, but for my purposes it's just extra clutter.  There are a zillion stickers on a page in the back;  we use the birthdays (there aren't enough) and end up throwing the rest away.  The calendar runs September through December, so it's nice for those who might like to go by school year (except that so many schools start in August).

The other gripe I have is that the paper isn't as weighty & bleedproof as I'd like, and the hanging holes (there are two) regularly tear through and must be reinforced/repaired with tape.

But I give it five stars because it is the ONLY oversized large-square calendar with  a storage pocket-- both of which are must-haves in our large family.  We have a ton of appointments and goings-on, and store sports/school/band schedules, invitations, tickets and church bulletins in that pocket so we can find them when we need them.

Highly recommended for those like me, but still wishing for something better!",4
"Often I am involved in meetings and discussions that involve the Bible.  I have several versions of the Bible and enjoy comparing the differences in wording.  Occasionally the different translations of a verse yield a different meaning.  Frequently the way a verse is worded  communicates more clearly the intent of the original text.

Sometimes when I attempt to turn to the specific verse I seek, it takes too long to find the verse I want.  Bible tabs solve that problem nicely.

I have previously used Bible indexing tabs. I found them difficult to mount on my Bible and an unclear guide after they were applied. So, I have been searching for better Bible indexing tabs.

Majestic Rainbow Bible Tabs are excellent for my purposes.  The tabs are large enough to be easily seen and color coded to enhance their use.  There are Different colored tabs for The Pentateuch, Historical Books, Wisdom Books, Prophetic Books of Old Testament.  A new set of colors help distinguish The Gospels and both the New Testament Letters and Catholic Letters.

A special bonus is that these indexing tabs are easy to use. I have never been very coordinated in crafts, and now that my hands are full of arthritis, it is tough for me to use small objects such as indexing tabs. These tabs are so well made that even I can apply them to a Bible. The set contains directions and spacing aids that take the guesswork out of applying each tab (for example: ""have I left enough space to allow the tab to be seen?"")  If I can do this, almost anyone can do this.

I highly recommend Majestic Rainbow Bible tabs.",4
"Great to use with an adult Bible, but wouldnt recommend using this for a child Bible. A little too delicate to be handled by kids.",4
"I like the different colors - my brain has now started associating certain books with their color, making them easier to find. They were fairly easy to put on, although it does take a while to get them all on. The letters are large enough to see easily. It is also quite satisfying that the colors are actually in rainbow order...for some reason that is extremely important to me :P",4
"These will do the job. But you have to be careful.
I made a number of mistakes.
I am happy with them anyway.
Thake your time and be careful.",4
Nice look and work well,4
I like Majestic tabs.,4
These tabs are very nice and make it easy to locate the books in the bible. They are a little tedious though to put on. Prepare to have 30 mins to spare.,4
Helps a lot with finding sections needed,4
"These are very handy for quick reference and look great. My only complaint is really my own fault, I didn't fully read the directions first.

A few pieces of advice:

1. Look at all of the labels first before you start putting them on. The first three sheets list the books you'd expect, so naturally I just started with sheet one. However, sheet four has a lot of ""special"" tags, like ""Old Testament"", ""New Testament"", ""Special"", etc. So for example, if you want a tab at the beginning of the New Testament that doesn't overlap Matthew, you'd have to plan ahead to put that tab first, before you put the tab for Matthew. In other words, look at all the tabs before you put any of them on, so you have a ""plan"" and it turns out right.

2. These come with an alignment sheet. Hint - align the top of the tab with the top arrow. My mistake was that I tried to ""center"" the tab. Since I eyeballed the whole thing, my tabs are sort of all over the place. If you align the top of the tab with the top arrow in the alignment sheet, it'll come out a lot more uniform.

3. Pay attention as you put them on. I was trying to hold a conversation at the same time I was putting these on, and didn't realize I put two tabs in the same position at first. Got about 10 tabs into it before I noticed my mistake. It is possible to remove the tab once it's on, just take it slow and carefully. But better not to have to in the first place.

Note - there are no tabs for the Apocrypha. I labeled mine with the ""Special"" tab, but you won't be able to label each individual book.",4
"I love these books. Even though my child will point out and recognize site words in books, on signs and anywhere there are words, these books bring it all together to show how the words form sentences. It gives her more confidence to try reading and sounding out other words in other situations. Her interest has waned since first buying the books, so I feel I need to go back and have her watch the videos again.

I skipped buying the level 1 and 2 sets because set 3 includes all the words from all 3 Site Word videos. We already read alot every day, so I don't think it is a stretch for my child to understand all the words rather than doing a slower ""build-up"" by buying the first 2 sets.",4
"I like it.
It's your standard calendar with all the days and dates in place.
The pictures are not particularly impressive.",4
"I wasn't that impressed with the photos; they are beautiful landscape photos but there isn't as much focus on the stars. It should have been called ""Night Sky"" instead - that would have been more accurate.

What I do like about this calendar is the extra events marked on the calendar, such as meteor showers, moon-planet conjunction, planet oppositions, lunar eclipses, solar eclipses and major celestial events.",4
"I received this product as a gift when I was given my first classroom. They are beautiful, but smaller than what I expected. They will still do for an average sized bulletin board, and can be seen across the classroom. However, they are pretty flimsy, so I would laminate them for long term use.",4
This is an excellent instructional tool as it clearly lays out what the terms are.  They are also colorful enough to draw the eye to them.,4
Excited to use these this year. Only real down side is that it doesn't come with pre cut slits for putting it on. Instead you'll need to staple the ends together to form the crown.,4
"Nothing special, but they're crowns!",4
Nice,4
Great for the poster boards,4
"I needed something to put all my posters in. However, I overstuffed it and some of the fabric ripped. I thought it would be a little sturdier.",4
"I expected this to be a little stiffer than it is.  It kind of just collapses in a heap. I may have to put in a sturdy piece of poster board or something to keep it flat until it has enough in it to stay flat on it's own.  I'm worrying about my bulletin board pictures getting folded in it, but eventually, I think it will be ok.",4
"Wroks great, good for larger projects.",4
I've never used the card system since I've only taught upper grades.  This is I'm teaching a 2/3 combo so I thought this was a nice chart.  It is very colorful and serves the purpose.  Keeping all the cards straight is a pain since there are the car/bus card and then the set of colored cards in each pocket.  I don't need the car/bus cards but I use it to keep the colored cards to one side so you can actually see which color the kids is supposed to be on.  THis is also on for 30 students=(  I teach in CA so classroom size is usually more than 30.  I have 34=(  I just had to make 4 additional pockets and cut out colored strips.,4
Nice bage.  It holds everything well and fits nicely in a small spot.,4
"Not very heavy duty and not well made, one of the yellow pockets has ripped out of the seam a little and the kids don't touch it. I'm using it for a job chart and it has 30 slots which was good for my 29 students.",4
Holds all of my standard charts for school and is very spacious.  Great buy. I have three.  Would love to get two more.,4
"Cute, small and takes up less space than most. I like that it has 30 pockets as my class size has been over 25 for years!",4
nice colors,4
"Great... the only down fall was when it was shipped came in a large box, and felt that was unnecessary.",4
"I originally got one of these when I was student teaching several years ago. It worked well, so I bought another one recently. This time it is to organize my art papers and pads by type. Most of my pads are 9x12, and the pockets can hold 2-3 books/tablets each. It is heavy, but the pockets are strong enough to handle it. The only negative is that it did not come with hooks. I didn't have any hooks small enough to go through the grommets, so I attached binder rings to the grommets and hung them from some over the door hooks, and it's working great. I should mention that the hooks were missing from the last one I bought too (we used clear packing tape that time). I don't know if they were missing or just not part of the package, but it's something to be aware of.",4
The extra storage provided by the vertical storage of these pocket charts has helped better organize my classroom,4
"I bought two of these for use in my classroom.  I wanted to be able to display my Junior Scholastic magazines.  I put about 10 in each pocket.  However, due to their size (8-1/2"" X 11"" magazine), they lean forward and make the pockets bow outward.  To solve this problem, I inserted one piece of cardboard (approximately 6"" X 9"" into the front of each pocket.  Problem solved.  Also, in order to save money, I hang both of these pocket charts using 5"" S-hooks on a garment rack.",4
These look really good on desks however they are a mess to remove!,4
My granddaughter loved it,4
"Should've paid attention to their size description. Much smaller than I figured, but I also was imagining ones I had as a child. They'll work though. My kid will get use out of them.",4
Very nice stencil set. Durable and lots of choices.,4
"I liked this set because you got a wide variety of stencils. The handle on the box broke within a month of use. Otherwise, this is a good set for a classroom or family.",4
kid like it,4
Very good for children.  They can spend hours with it.,4
Great for small fingers. Durable and easy to wash.,4
"Always so hard - when ordering online - to tell if something's going to be as neat as it looks/sounds when you see it in person.  As soon as they arrived,  I knew our oldest grandson was going to fall in love with them!  Each one of our three grandsons is special to us in their unique ways... our oldest has somehow combined a love of creativity and the power of an incredibly healthy and active imagination right along with a total level of comfortableness with math and science (at least as of 1st grade!)  We've always strongly connected on the creativity aspect, but I don't know where the math/science prowess came in (... had always heard one section of your brain was usually dominant over the other... overjoyed that both of his, at least for now, seem to be working in unison, since even the words ""math"" or ""science"" struck fear in my heart as a child!)

While he's always enjoyed the (mostly paper) stencils we've had, his younger brother (3 years old) got hold of them one day and did a number on them, leading me to want to replace them with something a bit sturdier.  Wow, these really fit the bill!  Terrific idea to put them into a sturdy little box (@ 6-1/2""L, 4-3/8""H, 2-3/4""W), and to color code each.  Green covers ""Fall"", ""Flowers"", ""Birds"", ""Trains"", ""Clowns"", ""Alphabet 1"" (capital A-K), ""Planes"", and ""Whales"".  Pink covers ""Winter"", ""Houses"", ""Cars"", ""Dinosaurs"", ""Alphabet 2"" (capital L-U), ""Family"", ""Spring"", ""Trucks"".  Blue covers ""Summer"", ""Cats"", ""Alphabet 3"" (capital V-Z, along with an exclamation point, question mark, dollar sign, equals sign, minus sign, apostrophe, period and double parenthesis), ""Underwater"", ""Dogs"", ""Winter 2"", ""Farm Animals"", ""Numbers"" (0-9, along with multiply, divide and plus signs.)

Our middle grandson (affectionately referred to as the Master of Disaster) is going to have a tough time destroying this nifty stencils, with each measuring @ 5-3/4""L, 4-1/8""H... they'll be so much easier to maneuver around than those big 8-1/2 x 11 paper ones we had - and these are translucent rather than opaque, which is a very nice feature (each INDIVIDUAL object even has its name imprinted in small letters next to it!)  The lid snaps shut securely, and there's also a neat little handle included that hooks onto the sides.  These were just PERFECT for us!",4
Excellent variety of stecils,4
"I have several granddaughters 6-8 years old who love to do art work.  I used to have a magnetic Crayola set and was hoping these would be similar.  While they're not magnetic, they love to use them.",4
"I bought this for a boy. My intuition is that a girl may like this a bit more.

Not bad, but a little on the little side. The case is about the size of a box of index cards. Each stencil is the size of a standard index card. Each stencil card has about a half dozen designs.

This set has loads of free-form exploration for a child.

I would buy this set again.",4
"My four year old daughter loves stencils, and this is a great set for her to use at her little desk at home.",4
Lots to create with these stencils. My preschoolers love them! Good sturdy plastic that can be used over and over again!,4
I love maps and this one looks great. It's already hanging on a prominent wall in my office. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.,4
"great price, I don't print much other than black & white documents but so far works as welll as canon ink.",4
"Excellent ink...love the price...one thing is, BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE INSTALLING THEM!!! I have gotten non-removable ink all over my hands more than once, and if you're not careful it can also get on your carpet or furniture. But these ink cartridges are really worth it if you're careful! Once in, they work/last just as well as the name brands for a LOT less money",4
"This set is cute, light and very good at what it was designed for - keeping daily records.  Each lightweight colour-coded booklet corresponds to each month and each page to each day (see photos).

Perfect for those in professions where there is a need to record time for billing and metrics purposes (Contractors, Consultants, Lawyers, Paralegals, Secretary pools, Doctor's working multiple sites, etc.,) The booklets are easy to carry around and Moleskine paper is also fountain pen, gel pen and roller ball friendly.  There is no show-through/bleed through.

This is not recommended for people who are looking for a planner, unless you are always at your desk or are willing to carry the ""brick"" of 12 booklets in their hardcover sleeve.",4
"This is a very nice gift for the Musician in your life, and I say ""gift"" because a Musician would not buy this on their own.  The problem is that it really does not serve much purpose as the flaws are the pages and sections that will never be used.

I am not a Musician, but an avid music collector.  I was thinking this might be something for me to organize so much.  But, not so much.  I have almost 2000 cds, over 30,000 songs on my ipod, I collect 78s and vinyl, and basically none of this is for any of this.  I can list concerts I have been to and note the set list.  But not sure why or how I would do that.  So I see this as a feature if I was the performer and could record dates and sets and maybe note audience reactions etc.  There are stickers galore for tabs, but none of which are relevant to something that would not be on your computer.  Actually all of this would be on your computer.  There are even tab stickers for favorite YouTube channels, Facebook profiles, etc.  I don't get it.  I mean, I applaud anything that tries to keep pen and paper alive, but there is hardly any point to any of this.

This is clearly for a Musician, but a specific one.  One who writes music.  There are several songwriting appealing features, however, the improvement to this journal idea is to actually work on a product doing a focus group with all type of artists in music.  If there was a simple journal for songwriters, that would be extremely appealing, and makes perfect sense.  But a songwriter using this will have half of it unused. A music collector, such as myself, could list sources of where I get my music, also have checklists of the rare and hard to find titles, and reference to favorites and collection completions.  A music lover of events, and concerts etc... a fan, could use the journal for their favorite acts or just one artist.  Then it would make sense to list concerts attended etc. A fan journal could also serve as an autograph book.  There are many ideas I have, and this did nothing but inspire them.

The price is ok, as it is very nice quality, and is a perfect gift.  But for function of specific use, it's a bit misguided and irrelevant.  If they take the idea of ""music"" and then create journals on the many avenues of it, then they have something of great appeal other than just a gift, but a product that would be bought for ample supply at hand.",4
"Just got this today and already love it!  The only thing I would have changed would be the tags as some of them I'm not sure what to do with such as the Music Map, but otherwise I found it really nicely organized.  It has six, labeled catagories.  Artists, Lyrics, Playlists, Concerts, My Life in Music and Music Map. It also has six blank catagories and lots of blank pages at the back along with staff paper and a ""music ruler"", which is nice if you're a musician.  It also comes with some adhesive labels, and a nice bit of black and gray ribbon to mark your place with.  THe back pockets are handy, one of the things I really like about Moleskine journals.  The front cover is nicely done, leaving no doubt what this journal is for.  This is a great gift for music lovers/musicians of any age and any kind of music.  This makes me wish I would have had one of these about 20 years ago!",4
"Moleskine is a legendary notebook used by European artists and thinkers for the past two centuries including VanGogh, Picasso and Hemingway.  The notebooks ceased being produced in 1986 and were sorely missed by their afficianados until their rebirth in Italy in 1998.  Now available in the US, these small but incredibly detailed notebooks are a prize to treasure for those who want to record on the spot their thoughts, experiences, commitments and appointments.  This set is beautifully made and contains one small volume for each month of the year.  Each notebook is numbered and contains a dated page for each day of the month that is lined but blank to journal whatever the owner likes.  Each book also contains pages for personal data, a month at a glance calendar for the whole year, the phases of the moon, international travel distances and holidays in countries throughout the world.  The monthly volumes are each a different color and there are clear stick-on labels to denote the month or month number should you desire.  Each book is 3 1/2 inches by 5 1/2 inches so it is small enough to fit into vest pocket or purse.  Every aspect of this set is of the highest quality and detailed to perfection.  It is beautiful as well as useful.

My only concern is that in this age of computers there are few of us who will still take the time each month to manually record important dates along with personal data into a new notebook.  As a Palm user since their inception long before they became a phone and a day planner user for decades before that, I could not imagine going back to the days when my contacts and appointments were all on paper in a day planner that I carried everywhere.  Having all my appointments, contacts and plans for years past and years future at my fingertips in my computer and phone has spoiled me for the more thought provoking use of the actual handwritten word.  Those who journal each day (I don't) will find this a wonderful way (if they write very small) to record the days events and thoughts.  The rest of us will stick with our phones and Outlook or Palm files.",4
"I really like these twelve colorful little notebooks, one for each month, with ruled pages for each day.  I'm much more likely to use these books as diary and place to record info than a planner.  Though there are little two-year calendars in each notebook, with a line for day where you can write something, I think people who are really into planning and scheduling would prefer a planner that covers the whole year.  If you jot a March appointment in your January notebook you are going to need to rewrite the info into the book for March, and that's sort of a pain.  The twelve soft covered, multicolored notebooks fit into a hard backed holder and look quite pretty.  I like the brighter colors particularly, could have done without the gray for December, but the overall effect works when they are all in the holder.  You can wind up with an attractive looking record of your year.

The books are geared for the particular year (the one I have is for 2010) with dates and days of the week printed.  If you use the January 2010 book for say January 2011 the days will be off.  The individual notebooks are well put together, stitched for permanence.  They are less than a quarter of an inch thick and virtually weightless.  I often have to carry huge, heavy books to and from my teaching job so I definitely like the light weight and lack of bulk.  The paper seems to be of good quality.  People who travel a lot will probably like the info in the front with a world map, international dial codes, international time zones and holidays, etc., though I really would have preferred a few more blank note pages.

This would make a nice gift for the new year, particularly for a creative person who likes to record his or her thoughts.",4
"I use Moleskine notebooks all the time but this is the first hobby specific one that I have owned, at first it seemed cute and not overly necessary until I started getting some nice wines that I didn't want to forget, and this is a perfect way to save the info before it disappears from my mind, especially when it comes to shopping in new wine stores where I'm not familiar with the layout and selection, I can take it with me and always have me favorites nicely organized in one neat little book.

This comes with stickers and some fun little parts, so far I'm quite pleased with it, it's a bit larger than the notebooks I used but that's fine because it's easier to find in my purse if I take it with me, I also love the little embossed wine bottles on the cover.",4
"I've wanted a decent wine journal for some time, and was excited when I saw this one.  The execution fell a little short though.  The book is black, hardcover, with an embossed wine bottle and glasses, it's pretty cool looking.  There is an elastic bookmark that helps keep the book closed, that was handy.  The layout is where my biggest problems are.  There are a  couple of note pages at the beginning, a glossary, some pre-defined tabs are next, they are: sparkling, White, Rose, Red, Fortified-Sweet, and Spirits.  There were 6 tabs for you to define yourself after that.  The pages are all numbered and there is a spot for an index in the back which I liked quite a bit.  The notes sections in the pre-defined sections didn't seem quite practical, each page will hold information for one wine.  Information about the suggested glass, ideal pairing, and where/when/with who didn't seem to add much value.  I would have liked a more open format like the undefined tabs have.  Those tabs are broken into 5 blank sections, so you could run on with some reviews and be terse with others.

The final part of the book is a pocket, I guess for receipts or labels.  There are a number of stickers some are for the undefined tabs, others are to decorate your reviews.  There is also information on how to download templates that would be pasted into the book.  I'm not sure that the binding would withstand too many pages pasted in.",4
"I love Moleskine, and have been using their notebooks and planners for a long time.  They are durable and look good, and have high quality paper.  The Passions series is designed for taking notes on various hobby subjects - in this case wine.  There are sections for different types of wine, each of which is filled with forms that allow you to fill in the details and take notes on individual wines.  There are also several completely blank sections for filling out whatever additional details you might like.  This would make a nice gift for the right person.  I don't think I'd actually use this, since it's a bit big for convenience (it would fit in a purse or a backback, but not in the pocket) and wine's not my thing, but for the afficionado I expect it'd be perfect.  I'd use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moleskine-Passions-Film-Journal/dp/8862933177/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moleskine Passions Film Journal</a>, though I'd prefer a pocket-sized notebook.",4
"I always travel with my small Moleskine blank notebook where I sketch, write notes, quotes, ideas; I even have entire books summarized in them.  At 5.5 by 8.5, this book is a little large to carry comfortably in a purse or pocket.  The book is the customary high quality Moleskine product. It has a nice embossed cover with wine glasses on it. It also has double pockets in the back where three pages of stickers are stored.  The interior of the book is already divided and tabbed into wine categories - sparkling, white, rose, red, fortified, sweet - with several more blank tabs.  Each page has a place for you to list the wine, vintage, grapes, % alcohol, producer, country-region, pairing, serving temperature, suggested glass (with little pictures), price, and more.  These pages only comprise about the first half of the book.  The remaining part of the book (with the blank tabs) just have blank sections.

Would I buy this book for myself?  No, probably not, although I was very interested to see what it looked like.  But it would make a great gift for the wine aficionado or as a hostess gift. Perfect for someone who is really into all the nuances of wine.",4
"I was looking for a small calendar for my purse that wouldnt take up alot of room or be bulky. This one is perfect. I buy alot of moleskine books for mix media journaling art projects but this is my first calendar from them. I like that it has a band on it so it won't open while it is in my purse. It is small but there is room to write on each square for appointments etc.. I would have given it 5 stars had it come with a pen and a pen holder on the side, that would of been super handy.",4
"Okay, I never worked as a wine critic, BUT there were a couple years where I was really obsessed with cataloging my wine (tequila and scotch) experiences.

Before this journal, I'd track things, but forget to collect various details. As a result when I'd go back to review I'd be wondering what I meant about some of the stuff I'd written.

This journal is very well organized and ensures I keep an accurate account of my imbibing experience...both the factual details and my opinions.",4
"These are the prettiest notebooks I've ever used and I will definitely buy them again. They're super thin so if you're looking for something for a class this is not the notebook for you, though. If you want something to jot down lists in, or thoughts, this notebook is perfect.",4
"My girlfriend likes to keep things old-school (digs paper, shuns digital journals).  She really enjoyed these as a gift.  Quality seems nice.",4
Good but expensive,4
Nice and great size!,4
very nice art journal i will have to open the back eventually and expand the journal due to the mixed media,4
"I like the idea behind this book and the paper is pretty good but not as good as the Stillman & Birn Zeta Series Hardbound Premium Sketchbook 5.5x8.5. However, that being said, this book is going with me to Italy. Has more pages and will be fine for what I'll be using it for. Sketching, journaling and collecting stuff.",4
"Fell apart after 2 years, but I gorilla-glued the cover back on so it works ",4
"Nice, compact, and moderate quality paper.",4
was a gift,4
"It's a nice little pocket ""reporter"" notebook. Medium-gray hairline ruled .234375 in on cream paper. Stitched binding. Pocket on inside back cover for whatever. Best use with ballpoint or pencil, rollerball will show through. (As usual, pricey for what it is as are all Moleskine products, no doubt making a killing as they're all now made in China for pennies on the dollar.) Yep, I bought it anyway, mainly for its small form-factor.",4
"Super small books, but great for little notes when at work.",4
"I'm really bad at reading and understanding dimensions, but these notebooks are tiny. They are basically the size of my hand. So they're not as useful as I thought they would be, but they are nice quality and classic Moleskin if you're looking for a little notebook to stuff in your wallet or briefcase.",4
"This is a great little pocket notebook.  It's very convenient, fits easily in any pocket, and it looks much more classy to take a quick note or jot down a phone number in this rather then your smartphone.  I also like how the pages can tear out easy, but not too easy so they won't fall out by accident.  I have tried out a bunch of little note pads this year, and these are my favorite.  The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the front and back cover was just a little stiffer or more substantial.  After about a month or so with the pad in my pocket the cover's corners started to separate a little (to clarify what was separating I am talking about the moleskin cover and the thin cardboard backing that it is glued to).  This wouldn't keep me from buying it again though.  I recommend this!",4
"You can't beat the size of these great little notebooks!  I needed my own ""little black book"" to carry with me daily for writing down ideas as they popped into my creative and impulsive little head.  I could find nothing ""pocketable"" in a pair of jeans that didn't stick out and add bulk until I stumbled across these small ""Volant"" notebooks by Moleskine.  I'll probably have to switch out my current book before I finish writing in it simply because the covers and pages wear from rubbing against everything else I stick in my pockets, but there are plenty of pages in each one for jotting down tons of ideas, lists, contact info and ""to-dos"".  The fact that they come in a 2-pack is a huge bonus!  Highly recommended.",4
"I am someone who loves to travel and I was happy to purchase the travel moleskine notebook when I saw it. The notebook is not so much a travel journal as it is a travel planner notebook. Its usage is meant to help you as your planning a trip, as well as to give a short description of memorable experiences during your travel. I am someone who likes to write  A LOT, especially about my travels to remember every moment. At most you get half a page to a full page to note your travel experience, and notebook is not the largest, but travel size. Travel expeditions are further limited in the book to sections depending on the duration of your trip, whether, you had a weekend, short, or long trip. I felt it was limiting for me since I would rather write my experience for it's full duration instead of jumping all over the place. I really like the book because I love moleskine journals, it's leather feel of the cover, its compact size. However, if I knew the limitation I would have to put on writing my experiences in the travel journal, I don't know it I would purchase it again. Maybe it's for someone else.",4
Good,4
Attractive and useful notebook that fits in your pocket. Lines are wide enough to write on and hold enough info. Sturdy and useful tool.,4
"good quality, a little hard to use the large size.",4
"Love the quality of this notebook.  Durable cover with perforated pages.

I like to keep one with me everyday in my back pocked.  While this has the durability to make the long haul, it is a little smaller than what I am used to and I often find myself wishing for a little more page space.  Next time I will get the next size up.",4
Perfect pocket size.  Perforated pages for tear out.  Holds up well.  It's paper with lines on it.  Good product for my use.,4
"This is a great pocket sized notebook for taking notes. I find it very useful for brainstorming and writing things down. Most of us have smartphones, but I find that it's easier to scribble into a notebook. It's a good way to track things and make calculations, and be able to keep those calculations. I do a lot of inventory work, so I'm always writing things down and crossing them out, and putting numbers next to items. It is a good quality notebook, with a rubber band to keep the book closed. Fits perfectly into my jacket pocket. It is a bit expensive though!",4
"The build and quality are great--true to reputation.

I thought this was a medium-sized notebook (smaller than full letter size, but larger than a wallet...which is this one); turns out I should have spent a little longer looking at the dimensions. I bought the larger version at a local bookstore and should have realized the price was too good to be true for an exact replacement. Oh well, this will turn into a portable travel journal.",4
"We recently found out I'm pregnant, and I bought this journal because I love regular moleskine journals so I thought it would be fun.  And it does say it's for during pregnancy too, so it seemed appropriate.

Eh, not really.

I think this would be better for someone who is due in a week or something, because the pregnancy part has a section ""How it all started"" and a page about choosing names, and a page about the name selected, but other than that it's all about getting close to birth, not exactly about the pregnancy experience. Definitely nowhere for me to write that I'm craving guacamole, which I've only sort of liked before.

There are nice, complete sections about birth/homecoming, and fun things like a section for you to fill in ""special moments"" (including a checkbox for if it was the first time Baby did something), and a section for recording Baby's first foods, and how those went over.  There is a medical section that is much larger than I hope we will actually need.  There's also a recipes section, which, I don't know what sort of things would be worth recording there, but whatever, it could be fun.

There are also several sections with blank tabs, two are lined, two are sectioned off (like, for writing cute things Baby says, or something), and two are blank (for drawings or photos, the bottom of the page says).  The tabs that you can use for the blank sections seem a little weird; some say ""Facebook"" and ""YouTube"" so...I don't know what you would put in sections like that, but there are also a bunch of blank tabs so you can make your own.

Since this is going to be our first child, I'm not sure how relevant these sections will all be, but they seem like things that would be fun to look back at later.  I'm disappointed that there isn't much to fill in yet--I guess I'll just record my experience with pregnancy in my regular journal.  There's a family tree part in this journal, so I've been filling that out.  Mostly I'll just have to wait to make use of this, though.  Oh well.",4
"I ordered this for my husband and did not read the size. I honestly didn't even know they made one this tiny. My fault for not reading, but he won't get much use out of this.",4
"These notebooks are extremely nice items, but for what they are they have a very high price point.

Some inks will bleed through the quality Moleskine paper, but I usually use pencil anyway (soft pencil which necessitates using a sheet of paper under a written sheet to prevent transfer when the obverse side of the page is written on). I prefer squares to lined paper. I don't know why but I feel more comfortable writing on quadrille paper than lined. All my notepads are quadrille too.

Too big for a pocket (maybe an overcoat pocket would accommodate it), but a useful size - small notebooks and I don't mix well. I also find that I need a second book of the same design as a rest when the book is new-ish in order to lay the left-hand page I'm writing on on a flat, even surface. Hard covers lessen the problem of course, but every time I use one of these I'm tempted to just use the right-hand page and flip it over when I get to the end of the book 8o).

The cover is a nice bright red, much as depicted in the photo. The elastic and bookmark are also the same shade of red. There's a pocket at the back too, though I find these of less use than some. I'd rather the pocket were in the spine and that it hold a small pencil so I'd have something to write with wherever I had the book.

I'm docking a star for cost. The difference in materials between this and a four dollar book simply doesn't  justify the asking price.",4
"Good notebook.  I love the binding cover and the look.  However, the paper in them isn't as good as in other notebooks.  Using a fountain pen or a thick rollerball pen you get bleed-through to the other side which doesn't happen with many other good notebooks.",4
"I wish I could give a 5 star review. I love Moleskine, and the watercolor album is great. The pages don't show through with watercolor or ink. The paper has a bit of a 'tooth' to it, so it is fantastic for watercolor. I don't recommend it for sketching or ink work because the texture can cause a 'wiggle' in your mark making. But overall it's great for watercolor and I like the fact that it is bound on the top edge of the book. I am taking a star away just because my book came with loose stitching on one page, so that the page fell out when I opened it the first time. The other pages are fine, it was just one page, but it was the first page in the book!",4
"Good size, nice cover, and nice paper weight. Very durable, but 4 stars because I don't feel they're quite worth the price. You can get an equivalent hard copy style for less, although I do like the elastic closure.",4
"I've used Moleskine notebooks for several years in my research and writing projects. Sure, you can get cheaper notebooks of the same size, but Moleskine wins in the many small details, like the little envelope in the back, the place-keeping ribbon, and the outer elastic band. The paper is always excellent quality.
This calendar was particularly useful for me because it spans summer 2011 and all of 2012 -- which just happened to coincide with laying out my symphony season schedule, which starts in September and goes through next Spring. It's the handy middle size that you can put in almost any bag and take along. I highly recommend it.",4
good,4
"I purchase this to make a ""Mother's Day forever"" book for my wife. My daughter is 10 months old and I had her finger paint in the book and it help up. The weight of the pages could be a little thicker however, I was not using watercolors which would probably be fine.  I plan to paint with my daughter in this book for my wife for the next 18 years so wish me luck!",4
"Can't comment on what it's like to paint on the paper, but I love Moleskine products and this one looked just as great as any other I've purchased.",4
I plan to use this to make watercolor sketches as I travel to distant places where I can not bring all my other material with me.,4
"I love these notebooks, and use them often for school work and/or personal journals. The slim design makes these easy to carry with you even in a smaller bag, and I like that they're lightweight.

I have noticed that the hum holding the back pockets together seems to be less sturdy than in the past, and hope this will be resolved soon.",4
"I love jotting down notes when I'm traveling or visiting museums but find hand-held notebooks aren't big enough and standard Moleskine hardbound notebooks are awkward. These are just perfect. I keep one in my handbag. It doesn't take up much room, but I always have a notebook with me.",4
"I bought this as a gift.  She loves it!  However, would I buy this for myself? No.  At 4/5 stars, I would say it is worth the price for most people just not me personally.  It just does not go above and beyond to amaze me.  And it probably has to do with my field or work and my way of thinking which requires a lot of reworking the problem.  For such an expensive notebook, I am a little scared to run through the pages so quickly.

It is well made though.  Very much a high end book.  I bought if for myself a few years ago, and I remember I liked the band that keeps it closed and the flap at the end to hold receipts or money in.",4
"I think Moleskines are completely overpriced, but it seems that all notebooks with quality art paper are.  Maybe I'll develop a love for them the more I use them.

I do handlettering and it's true that you need good paper to keep your letters from bleeding and feathering.  Moleskine paper is good paper, so I'll keep paying the price!",4
"I love writing in this Moleskine.

This notebook has no lines. The quality of the paper is OK. There is some bleed thru depending on what pen you are using. I use a extra-fine fountain pen so there isn't that much ink that goes through.",4
I've loved these little notebooks for years.  Sturdy covers and binding don't wear out even after repeated in-and-out of pockets in the hottest & sweatiest weather.  But this will be my last one due to price.,4
"I simply use the squared version more.  If I were to buy this again, I'd get the soft cover.",4
"Moleskins notebooks and journals are pretty well made, with pretty good paper. I say only ""pretty good paper"" because Noodler's Nightshade ink in a nicely flowing fine point fountain pen bleeds or can be seen through the paper, so tiny writing on both sides can be hard to read.

Pro: Tiny, fit anywhere.
Con: Tiny, can't write much on a page.

Life is about choices. Find the size you like.",4
I need a notebook for work all the time and am unable to carry one around. This one works well because it fits in my pocket without an issue. It is pretty small so if you are looking for a larger notebook I wouldn't get this.,4
"This little book is perfect for my small handbag. I can jot notes, etc without digging through a large bag. The color is my favorite 7 moleskin is my favorite as well....maybe because I've used the product for such a long time.
All the notebook are good from small to large.",4
"This is a nice journal to have. My only complaint is that the fine Sharpies I tend to use bleed through the paper. So the paper is a little thinner than I would like. However, I have switched to an archival quality pen and had no more difficulties.",4
"The notebook is high quality and the plastic ""staff"" ruler is a handy addition. The pages are smaller than I expected so if you're a rookie at writing music (which I am) this is probably not for you. However, if you're an experienced writer who wants something to keep with them so you can record when the inspiration strikes, you'll love this book.",4
i am trying to get into the culture.  this is neat.  smaller than i though but that is no way the products fault.  i should have used a tool instead of acting like one.,4
"nice book, nice to write in. decent memo book",4
Adequate for my needs. Don't care for Moleskine's high prices though.,4
"I like it. Very nice quality. It s very specific. I don't think I need it to so specific so I just write in whatever I want, not worrying about what heading is showing. So far this is the best journal I have found for gardening.",4
Like the organization of it and room to personalize.  Nice size; portable but large enough for writing.,4
"I love the quality feel of the notebook itself, but the paper seems to be very thin to me. I think it would be 5 starts definitely if the paper was just a little bit thicker. With the current thinness, it feel like I would be better off using a pencil which I really do not want to use. However, I bought this to take notes and write down ideas at work, and it is serving me very well.",4
"It's a plain black notebook. The pages are pretty thin, but I love the look and how convenient it is.",4
"Good quality notebook, nice feel to the cover.
paper quality is also superb for ink and pencil drawings and note taking.",4
really thin paper...can't use it for what i actually want but great for writing.,4
"For the price Moleskine is the best value and quality. Great for notes, journaling and drawing.",4
"My second planner like this, I like the soft cover which makes it easier to slip into my back pocket. Enough space for daily entries and a whole page for notes or other entries. Well made and the paper is nice. I'd give it 5 stars but I don't want to encourage them to charge more $.",4
"I bought two Folios, neither shipped with the adhesive tabs shown on the paper wrapper.  The spines are not silver/gray, which would allow me to quickly differentiate among my several Moleskine Notebooks -- this one's solid Black (just like my numerous other Large Notebooks), the other is solid Violet.  They're great quality, as expected, but they're not exactly as described.",4
"I really like this planner. I usually prefer a monthly and daily format, but this works well to help me stay on top of what I would like to get done each day. I do use google calendar for everything else, so if I wasn't doing hat I wouldn't get this calendar. It's just not big enough.",4
"Cheap, durable, enough space for me to write my daily to do lists and schedules with a fine point fountain pen. I like the space on the right side for more notes as well.

I use a leather franklin christoph leather cover for mine, which also enhances the durability, and it is a well made product. Other organizers have chipped or fall apart by year end. This thing did not. Still looks pretty good and new even though the 2011-2012 version I carried with me everywhere for the whole year. It gets tossed around and banged around, but still looks fine and didn't fall apart.

Good organizer and cheaper than others that are less durable.",4
"Good pocket journal/planner. I use them to keep track of ideas, school, and work. Also very durable.",4
"Hardbacked, classic Moleskine book.  Moleskine quality and emerald green color reminds me of Oz and wizardry.  Not my favorite because I can fill it up in about 1 hour with colorful thoughts (using my Mr. Sketch,Pilot and Sharpie stash).  Of course, that says more about me than about this item.",4
"Great product, I like that there is a folder in back where I can keep receipts.  The size is perfect for meetings with clients as it is not intimidating to them and lets me take my notes.",4
Works great. For a kid in school. Came fast and was exactly what was desired.,4
As expected.,4
"You can get these lined, gridded, blank, whatever. I like the grid. Perfect size to toss in your purse, pocket or in my case camera bag. Good for notes and has a gusseted pocket on the inside back cover. Probably over-hyped with the Hemingway et al, connection but nevertheless a good buy and a good thing to have nearby.",4
"Moleskine products are always really nice and I didn't read the description on this one close enough.  I was looking for a plain sheet, but when I got it, realized this one was graph lined.  That's fine for me, I love graph paper too.  Quality sheets that take ink or pencil nicely and don't bleed thru.",4
"Fine, just as expected.",4
"durable, works well for field notes at my job",4
"I have been using Moleskines for years to write and draw in. They've become some of my favorite sketchbooks! My art is mostly alcohol marker-based, and while the markers do bleed through the fairly thin pages, I'm used to it. I simply put a piece of scrap paper behind my work, and don't have to worry about ruining the next page. I've just filled yet another Moleskine and will be repurchasing very soon, perhaps the larger size this time around! Great notebooks. I do wish the covers were a little more sticker-friendly, though :-)",4
"The paper is fairly thin, and the ribbon place mark is rather flimsy. If this were made with slightly better materials it would be an out of the park product, but for me as is it's only a 4 stars.",4
This is a great little notebook that was the favorite of many creative minds in history. The thick binding adds some class as well as protects your writings and the band is a nice touch. I only wish that the pages were perforated because it's basically impossible to rip out a page without messing up the remaining pages and binding.,4
"good quality, a little hard to use the large size.",4
Moleskin is a good product and it fits nicely in my small leather journal,4
Basic moleskine book. Go through a few of these a year at work.,4
"I truly appreciate the Moleskine journal line, especially this victory red classic notebook.",4
"I really like this. I wish there were a variety of LEGO colors to choose from. That said, this definitely has the quality that I expect from Moleskine. I can't wait to see what they come up with for next year's Limited Edition Planners.",4
nice little notebook..pretty durable and nice paper,4
I started carrying these a few months ago. I like to carry the plain paper notebooks for sketching. I have found the graph paper works better for me for note taking. The pocket in the back cover is very helpful as is the tear out pages in the back.,4
good,4
"Arrived on time, well-packaged. Item as expected.",4
"Overpriced, but these are nice compact notebooks.  Definitely a luxury item.",4
"I took the hard cover A4 as a journal on my road trip from Shanghai to London and It didn't break, even under rain and extreme stress.
The pages are a sexy 100gsm, really nice to write on.
As a bonus, It looks cool as hell, professional and s***.

The smell is the main problem with this thing. First time I opened it, the smell hit me. Really bad, I swear.

But overall I'd recommend it.",4
"They am what they am. They am utilitarian notebooks, nothing especially good or bad. A little pricey but handy and you can get them in a variety of page styles (graph, lines, etc.).",4
"I've been using Moleskines for years now.  I've heard about them prior to my use, but I always thought, like many, it's all hype and can't really be that good.  When I was in London, I found myself wandering throughout Europe much and thinking about things that were too personally valuable to forget, so, being lightweight and easily portable, I bought the smallest version of the Moleskine notebook.  It was a price well paid, as the notebook has lasted to this very day, and only needs some black duct tape on the spine from cracks (I've beaten it up pretty good).

Now that I'm in graduate school, I ran out of all of notebook space I've used throughout high school and undergrad, so, being spoiled by Moleskine, I thought about getting these folio versions.  Why didn't I get them sooner?!
Sure, they're highly priced, and for some they may not be worth it.  But for someone who spends a great deal of writing and looks for details in such things as notebooks, Moleskine has done well with these mass-produced folios.

They measure the standard A4 (European) size, come with the ubiquitous strand to keep it shut, bookmark ribbon, and back inside pocket.  The paper quality is the same, and it's a charm to write on during class!

Now concerns the 4 stars.  The only beef I have is that the durability of the covers doesn't seem as strong as the smaller versions.  My first time carrying it in my backpack, I already noticed a dent in one of the corners.  I'm not one to toss my backpack onto the floor, but considering it dented its first use leaves me slightly puzzled.  I haven't had any other problems thereafter, but the covers do seem slightly softer than the smaller versions, so we'll see how it holds up in the long run.",4
"The book is good overall, with good binding. The paper is smooth, thin and recycled, to the ink ""bleeds"" through  and you can write on only one side of each sheet. Once you accept that,it is OK. It seems that virgin cellulose is seldom used nowadays, and it will be hard for you to find a non-recycled diary.",4
"Might as well order on Amazon, price seems fine. These are exactly what you think you are getting - the smaller moleskine books.",4
I bought this because it is a decent size for me and has a firm binder that makes it easier to write in.,4
It has a satisfying weight and pleasant texture on the cover and paper but the cover gouges and scratches very easily. It's nice if you're trying to go for that heavily-used look but it would be nice to have a little more durability. The paper is a bit smooth to the touch which makes it a little harder to write on with lower quality ballpoints which is what gives this a four star.,4
"For me, at least.

I need a paper planner for a number of reasons, but the most important to me is that I'm a tactile kind of person and like to hold the book not look at a screen, and that the act of writing helps me remember appointments and tasks where typing does not.

The seven days of the week on one side and a lined page on the other is the best format for me. I have relatively few appointments, but many tasks per week that go on the lined page.

I've had Moleskine products with the soft cover, and they are OK for light use, but I carry and use a planner almost constantly. This lost the planner a half a star. Regardless, the hard cover stands up to this use better.

Other planners have the address book that slips into the pocket in back. I miss that, and that is what lost this product the rest of that star.

The pocket size (3.5 in by 5.5 in)just doesn't have enough space, and if I cram it, the writing is too hard on the eyes. This one, the large book is about 8 in by 5 in, and much more comfortable to write in and read, while not being excessively bulky.

The spare blank pages, the year overview calendar, and the pocket inside the back cover are above and beyond what I expect in a planner, but I have grown accustomed to them and use them regularly.

Excellent tool, and I recommend it to anyone who prefers (or might prefer) a physical rather than virtual planner.

E. M. Van Court",4
Fits pocket easily. Only wish it held open better.,4
Husband prefers these for work.  Seems to like the size and professional look.,4
very nice book large and easy to write in.  My daughter loved it - I kkow she will use it often.,4
"I was hoping that the paper would be a bit better since it was labeled ""art plus"". There really was no info on the paper at the time of purchase. If you are used to moleskine sketchbooks (as opposed to notebooks or watercolor albums) you will probably find many great uses for this one.

The overall thickness of the book is greatly reduced from the moleskine sketch which makes it much easier to slip into a thin bag, such as an ipad bag for example. It is a very thin sketchbook. The horizontal accordion folding makes it perfect for extended panoramas. Basically, you are no longer limited in width of page since it may be extended on the go. About the paper: it appears to be equal or slightly thinner than the moleskine sketch paper. Sakura Micron pens or similar are the perfect media for this paper. You can saturate a bit with the Microns and not bleed through making the back side of the paper usable.

It will take fountain pen ink, but not very well. Water based inks from fountain pens tends to bead up slightly due to the almost waxy finish. Graphite or sharp charcoal pencils will also work although the smoothness of the paper will tend to smudge easier.
It does not take watercolor. Watercolor will just bead on the surface unless scrubbed in. Hope that helps. If you enjoy working in pencil and fine-liner, this may be for you. If you want to lean more towards watercolor in a moleskine, make sure to get the ""watercolor album"" instead.",4
"My very first moleskin. Upgrading from a Muji. While I got this for $8 on discount with a code found on Slickdeals, the book for the price isn't bad figuring retail is $17 before tax. Heck half off is fantastic. The book outside is great and has the hard front and back cover with the elastic bad to keep the book close and pages secure while writing. Only issue I'm having is the pages. The pages are thin and I use a Pilot G2 .07 pen to write as the pen glides on the paper and most paper. The pages are so thin that the ink does seep through. I used a recycle paper to put on the back of the page that I'm writing on to make sure it doesn't seep onto the other pages to minimize the ink damage. Overall, I rate 4 out of 5 due to the thin pages but I'm very happy with what I paid for, $8.04, and the quality of the exterior.",4
"Love the pocket in the back. Pages are slightly sheer, but fine if you don't use gel pens. I wish there were move cover color options.",4
"If you are a project manager, this notebook is for you. If you are a ""free thinker"" (aka you can't be boxed in with lines and boxes when you record your notes and ideas), go for one of the many other moleskine selections better for you. This notebook wasn't for me because I am not a project manager and have terrible note-taking styled. I opted for the graph paper notebooks and love them. (At least they keep my writing looking neater!)

I wished this notebook was softcover; I am always looking for ways to reduce weight in the things I must carry regulatory. If carrying/weight is not an issue, the hardcover makes for nice presentation and is durable beyond imagination.

A good purchase, if your needs match the unique features it offers.",4
"I love the size of these notebooks, and I love the grid paper...my only complaint is that the pages are thin...I use these as junk journals, regular daily journals too, and I find I have to glue two or three pages together so my ink doesn't bleed. But they're still amazing!",4
"It's a notebook of great quality, but writing in it is not that comfortable.",4
good,4
"These notebooks are nice and thin, with flexible covers. I like that they aren't bulky and they lay flat when you open them. I have one or two of them nearby at all times to take down notes or do sketches in. The pages are strong, but not stiff; the color is off-white or cream.

The page aren't thick and wetter media will show through, so it is inconvenient to use both sided of the page if you're using heavy black ink such as fountain pens or felt tips. Ball-points and pencils are ideal in these books.

I haven't yet decided if I am going to continue buying these, or carry on the search for the perfect notebook. They're useful, simply made and inexpensive, but still... I'm not in love.",4
"I cannot count the amount of Moleskine we have around the house, cars, all my purse's must even have one!! The entire family loves these and use them like we drink water!!

The only thing i would REALLY recommend though to Moleskine is that the flap in the back where you can place small papers/cards/etc., do be made with a tougher/stronger material because after a few light uses it starts to tear and i have retired a few because of that or just ripped it off and use it without the flap.

Either than that its a 5 star!!",4
This is a very nice journal and I look forward to writing in it.,4
"The top and bottom back corners tear apart after a few months of use, would love to have them strengthened.",4
"This moleskine notebook is useful for mindmapping, doodling, jots, etc. I take pictures of my notes and sync them with Evernote. The pages are a good size to grab and go or keep stationary. A lot can be done with these notebooks. Only issue I have with this notebook is that it can damage easily with extended use.",4
There's something about scribbling in a Moleskine or other similar pocket notebooks that keeps me returning to it for notetaking.  Fits in my back pocket and also slides in nicely in my briefcase.,4
Good! I like it!,4
"Great little book, and very helpful! I use Evernote for almost everything and occasionally just need to write some stuff down and save it for later. This is a well made little book and I love that the band keeps it neat and closed in my purse. The grid on it supposedly helps Evernote to read your handwriting better and digitize it.",4
Works as expected,4
"Moleskines are usually small, portable and supposed to be your most intimate personal notebook. Your natural and greener PDA. A perfect pocket companion.

The name has a history in itself. It came from a nickname that British writer Bruce Chatwin (""Songlines"") called his favorite notebook. The cover is made of oilcloth (vinyl-permeated cotton mesh) not leather.

This one measures 5 1/2"" x 3 1/2"". It has a garter that is nicely tucked inside the back leaf cover, to keep it close when not in use. The acid-free pages are thick, with lines and beige in color. (Why acid-free? Acid-free paper preserves documents for longer periods of time). A piece of fabric string hangs in the middle as book mark. At the back flap, inside is a pocket that expands so you put any items such as business cards, etc.

Designed in Italy. Made in China.",4
Great for taking notes and keeping track of stuff during a busy day,4
"Very nice size, quite convenient.  pretty color.  The paper is okay, but does allow for a lot of shadowing from anything heavier than a bic pen.  Definitely not very fountain pen friendly paper.  lots of feathering and shadowing.  It's okay.  Would be fine for colored pencils, but I don't recommend anything wetter than a ballpoint.",4
It's a solid notebook. I don't love it but I like it!!!,4
Great for haiku. I would love if it could hold a pen or pencil on it.,4
"I recommend this article only if you can take care of your things. And by that I mean that you never loose stuff. This is a pretty expensive notebook that does not serve any other function. The paper quality is average, thin paper that will bleed if you use roller point or marker. BUT if you are looking for a very neat and elegant notebook this is what you need. The higher price is justified by the distinctive Moleskine look. So if you want to impress every time you take a quick note don't look any further.",4
"I think this is the nicest notebook you can buy.  I just wish they made a larger hard cover notebook.
One thing that bugs me is that they say ""imported from Italy"", but it says on the notebook printed and bound in China, designed and assembled in Italy.  I don't care where it comes to the US from, to me that's made in China, and it should have a made in China price to go with it",4
"I am starting to use this as a to-do list to take to meeting even with a smartphone. The size is perfect and very sturdy as well.

Appreciate the closure band, the page marker as well as the storage pocket.

I use it as my analog notebook when too lazy to take a laptop.",4
"This notebook has served me well for six months.  Unfortunately, the paper is better suited to ballpoint or rollerball pens than to fountain pens.  For most readers, this won't be an issue. Recommended!",4
"Moleskin what can I say, I love these notebooks.  It is a perfect companion to a busy professional or student and a perfect size to carry around.",4
"I got this book so I can use it when taking notes for my videos. Nice size, good rule, can't complain.",4
"Nothing wrong with the product, it's just a bit too small for my purposes. I ordered the next larger size and I am pleased with the results.",4
"I use a Lamy fine point Al-Star fountain pen and can't use regular Moleskine journals because the ink bleeds through so badly that it's unreadable. For some reason the paper in the Cahier is different than the paper in the regular Moleskine journals. There is still a hint of show-through but it's definitely not enough to make it illegible. I've bought the tan color which looks prettier in the picture than in person (imho). The blue is a beautiful dark blue with a slight gray in it. Very pretty blue. A little spendy, but they tuck in the back of my Levenger Circa junior daybook beautifully. You can fold the cover and pages back to lay flat without ruining the spine. The pocket in the back won't hold much but it's enough for tucking in a few items. They hold up beautifully. The spine is not wide enough to write on but the covers are very smooth. I use a metallic silver pen to write the journal dates on the cover. Very nice tactile feel. If the paper were just slightly thicker, I'd give it a five-star.",4
Good quality and very useful for me.,4
Papers are thinner than how they used to be.,4
"I am quite happy with that pen because it perfectly fits with my moleskine.

However I have two comcerns with it:
- the brand is indicaded in very small letters, we do not see very well that it is a molekine pen,
- the ink is a little bit to hard for moleskine paper and you see some traces from the other side of the page.

But anyway, even it could be improved, it is a good pen very pleasant to use.",4
"Pages are easy to write on and have only a little bleed-through (I only use one side of the page because of this).  The binding is solid and will lay nearly flat. The hard cover lets you write anywhere.  Overall, very good quality notebook that I expect will last for years.",4
Good item,4
"There's not really much you can ask out of a notebook, this one is a good size - the little page holder thing is made of a nice material, although it begins to fray almost immediately if you don't take care of it. The leather cover is just perfectly larger than the pages, so combined with the elastic strap it's capable of fending for itself in my backpack or desk without getting all crinkled up or dirty.

There's a little paper pocket in the back cover that's handy for stashing a note or something else relatively thin but none of the fun charts and tables you find in their day planners. Overall pretty great, wish they made a slightly larger one but that's probably due to my bad handwriting.",4
Really small,4
"I was wondering how well I would be able to write with a square pen and was pleasantly surprised to find how well it felt in the hand. Very comfortable. I am using this with my Moleskine Evernote Smart Notebook and they make a great combination. Great quality pen, good color and smooth.",4
"perfect size, not sure I like the binding though",4
"Lots of unnecessary stuff in the front section but otherwise perfect for my return to paper planning after an Outlook incident wiped out a year of notes!
Weekly layout is great with the days on the left for schedule & a blank page on the right for notes, etc.",4
"The size is perfect.  The binding is solid.  The paper is a good weight, and holds ink well.  The strap and bookmark are nice extras.  I like it.",4
"I like to journal and it's nice to distinguish my writings by journal colors...ECOSYSTEM is another brand I enjoy using but their quality seems to be going downhill, as their colors seem to crack from wear and tear on the spine...",4
this notebook holds up to being tossed around in my bad every day.  The band allows me to stash away other papers in it.  The one problem is you can only write on one side of the paper.,4
a moleskine is a moleskine. this special edition is nice but it doesn't really separate it from any other moleskins out there.,4
Love it. Could be better if it includes some pages for monthly planning. Now I have to draw charts myself for that.,4
I bought this for a journal and am not disappointed. High quality cover and paper. A great size for what I am using it for. I usually would not pay this much for a notebook but this is worth it.,4
It's a large Moleskine.  I doubt anyone would pay this much for a notebook if they weren't a fan of Moleskine.,4
"I'm really impressed with Moleskine.  I use mine for my journal.  I started writing again about a year ago and was using a different manufacturers book, that while not bad, just didn't seem to feel like quality, if that makes sense.

This Moleskine is great but my only complaint is that the paper seems a little too thin, which isn't an issue to me as the pens that I use don't bleed through.  If you don't use pens that will bleed through the paper then buy this.",4
"Soft cover, classy/professional looking and I actually like the elastic that allows me to put additional papers/post-its, etc... in it without it coming apart. As some other reviewers have previously mentioned, the paper itself is pretty thin - but, I think that's the trade-off for the planner itself being so thin - thus more portable (since it's light, I'm not likely to carry it around with me everywhere). I'm currently not doing a lot of sketch journal/planning, but if you're into that, these pages might be a little too thin for you. You might want to just consider buying a sketchbook and making your own planner. Gel-based ink can be seen through these pages when I use them, so I try to stay with regular ink or pencil. Felt pens and highlighters you can see from the other side when you turn the page as well. Any pens that are really ""inky,"" you'll probably see through on the other side. There's quite a few pages in the front of the planner that has information for a traveler, like time zones, flight duration, dialing codes, unit conversions, international sizes/conversion, ""monthly"" view - NOT in calendar format but just 2 columns. I don't really use those and end up putting a paperclip to hold those pages to the front cover of the planner so that I don't have to bother with them. Sometimes if I'm really pressed for scratch paper, I'll just write over them. But because the pages are so thin, you're not going to be feeling like you're carrying all that extra weight around. I've been using it for 4 months now, and like it, but I do wish the paper was a little thicker, so that if I don't have to pay attention to what kind of pen I'm using, or if I wanted to doodle/sketch journal, I can do it without worrying about not being able to use the other side.",4
"This notebook is a great way to carry your notes around. The cover is made of a hard plastic, so the book won't get crushed in a bag or pocket like the smaller Moleskines covered in brown paper. The pages are large enough so that your writing doesn't feel cramped, and you can draw things out big enough to easily share with with others (example: I diagrammed a football play for someone sitting across a small table, and they were able to follow without holding the notebook up to their face).
The paper quality is fine, but a word of warning: this notebook is probably best used with regular ballpoint pens. Most pens that use a wetter ink will bleed through and feather on the the paper in this notebook, so don't count on using a fountain pen or something of that short in conjunction with this notebook.",4
"Moleskine notebooks are known for their construction and the quality of the paper used within them. These Evernote Smart Notebooks are no different in that regard. I use Moleskines daily for note-taking, journaling, and sketching. Love them.

Evernote is an excellent (free) application for web, desktop, and portable devices that allows you to create digital notebooks and sync them so you have them anywhere. I happen to be a pretty heavy user of the various incarnations of Evernote and love it, too!

So it seems to be a natural fit to have Evernote Moleskines. So, what are you getting and how do they fit in with your standard workflow?

I could be wrong, but I think the idea is to bridge physical notebook users into the digital realm. Many people love to take notes on paper. With mixed text and sketching, it's really difficult to duplicate the efficiency of taking notes on a laptop or portable device. There are times when you're mainly typing, and that is highly efficient, but there's just something about writing it down that is satisfying. But then you have a digital world, as well. How to get those notes into Evernote for safekeeping, tagging, and later retrieval?  In this case, you simply take your note(s) and using Evernote's built-in page camera feature, snap a shot of the page. It then gets imported into Evernote and is synced across your devices.

What is different about these notebooks compared to a standard large hardback Moleskine squared notebook?
1. The cover is beautifully embossed with the Evernote logo and icons from the splash screen.
2. The elastic closure is green instead of black.
3. The squared grid is dotted instead of solid lines.
4. Included are 4 pages of stickers for marking up your notes. These can be used to help with tagging your notes.

It should be noted that you can use regular Moleskine notebooks in exactly the same way with the Evernote page camera to capture notes. So, while I think the green elastic and embossed cover make it worth it for me, you'll have to decide that on your own.

I would give it 5 stars if the dots used were lighter. The overall appearance of the grid carries the same weight as those of a standard moleskin squared notebook. However, because these are dotted lines instead of solid, it seems the dots are darker. Actually, there was some variation in dot darkness on some of the pages (maybe 20% are just a touch lighter). It's not distracting at all. I just would prefer them a bit lighter (or even to have a dot-square where only the corners are dotted like Leuchtturm).",4
"I love these Moleskine notebooks and have been using them as reading journals for several years.  It's soft, easy to carry, has ribbon page marker ans elastic to keep notebook closed when not in us. The best part is that the covers will lie flat when you press down on the spine, and then close perfectly when you are through writing.

One thing I have noticed is that the last few I've purchased were Made in China, which was not the case when I first started buying them.  The covers do seem a bit flimsier, but it is still a good product. RECOMMENDED",4
"Love the soft cover and the dotted pages, keeps everything neat without being overwhelmed by lines.  Good size for journaling",4
"First, this notebook is little larger than a typical paperback. It is smaller than the standard (8.5x11) notebook size.

The lines are college ruled and the notebook has a tendency to fold onto itself. So you must constantly use one hand to keep the notebook open and other to write on it.

The paper quality is quite good and the cover is of high quality ""skin"".

For me, I found writing in small college ruled notebook while trying to hold it open to be an unnecessarily cumbersome task. It affected my already illegible handwriting (good thing I can type well) to something even less than legible...a chicken scratch at its worst.

But I doubt others would have the same problem as me since my handwriting is an outlier terrible.",4
"This notebook just oozes quality just by looking at it. The acid free pages are thick and luscious and the binding is extremely strong.

It will be your companion for many years to come. It really is worth the extra money you pay for it.

The only thing i can complain about is the little flap in the back...Lets just say that it can definitely use some thicker/better paper material so it won't tear so easily.

I would definitely recommend and buy again!!",4
"I like the soft cover. Currently using it as a journal. I definitely prefer dotted to squared or lined or blank, so I'm pleased with the very light grey dotted pages. I wish there were page numbers, and I agree the quality of Moleskine paper has declined since I last bought a Moleskin about 3+ years ago. I really like the pocket in the back, too. Overall, if page numbers don't become a huge issue, and I end up not minding the decreased paper quality, I might repurchase, once this journal is filled. However, I've had better paper quality experience with the last Muji journal I bought, so I might try to find a Muji replacement for this journal when filled. Moleskine's a decent fallback option, though!",4
"I love these notebooks but the soft cover feels cheaper than the hardcovers I'm used to. On the back, you can see the bulging of where the straps are attached. Also, it is harder to lay the notebook flat. The color is a little off-it is a tad more green than pictured.",4
"I love it, love the color, love the good paper quality and the elastic band; it goes without saying that the pocket is great.  My only criticism is that I would like the binding to be flexible enough to bend it backwards.",4
very nice notebook. like the soft cover and it's much lighter weight than hardcover or Lechturrm but some ghosting on pages,4
"The covering of the spine is loosening,  but everything else is great.",4
"I bought one for the year, still using it and will probably use it into next year.",4
"This is my second purchase of this color an soft cover with the dots. I really like it, but if you're rough on your books (carry them around in your purse ect) be careful the binding eventually started coming undone. I bought it this second time for my ""at home"" book that I track a training log in. And got a hard cover for carrying with me for everything else. Also, like everyone else said the paper is thin. Only certain pens will work. I suggest looking up moleskin bullet journal pen reviews.",4
"I love these dotted notebooks! The paper is a bit thin, but I don't really mind-- my pens don't bleed or anything, there's just a little ghosting. It also fits perfectly into the pocket of my white coat so I can carry it around the hospital. Just purchased another one today!",4
Useful note.,4
I really like this little notebook but it a little pricey.,4
"It's a basic Moleskine, which is nice.  It has an Evernote-themed cover with an embossed elephant (very subtle).  And the ribbon and elastic is Evernote green instead of black.  You get the ""smart stickers"" which provide automated tagging of pages when you capture the page with the mobile Evernote app's Page Capture feature.

The stickers did nothing for me -- I have much more sophisticated tagging than I could accomplish with 8 different stickers.  But the book works well and the page capture gives you a nice crisp image in Evernote.  And you get a 3-month premium subscription extension.

If you're an Evernote Premium user anyway, and you like note-taking, then this is a good choice for you -- the 3-month extension gives you some of your money back.  But otherwise, I'd say that there are many other notebooks available that do the same thing for cheaper.",4
"I'm really happy that Moleskine finally started making softcovers with different colors.  I use these for sketchbooks and I'm really happy that I can finally have one in my favorite color instead of plain black.  My only issue with this notebook as opposed to previous softcover notebooks I've bought is that the binding seems particularly stiff, so stiff in fact, I had to flip through the book to ensure that it was actually stitchbound and not just straight glued.  I buy these because I can easily fold the front cover back onto the back cover while drawing (without the annoying metal spiral binding and the smudging that happens to pages in those sorts of sketchbooks), but that's a bit hard to do with this one.  I'm sure it'll ease out with use, but it still seemed stiffer than ones I'd bought in the past.",4
"As the treasurer for a small community organisation, I needed a Moleskine with a bit more space, and a page with a bit more structure. The Extra Large Dotted page fit the bill perfectly.

It's very easy to keep numerical records with the dotted framework, and the dotted pages leave lots of open space for legible entries. The elastic loop tends to warp the covers, minus one star.",4
"I love this book, my only issue is that the Mickey imprint isn't as apparent as i would like it to be.",4
"I've purchased approximately 5 variations of this notebook. It's very good at what it does. I prefer the blue to the beige/tope, which looks a bit like a russet potato skin. The notebook is very well bound with high quality paper that doesn't feather when I use my fountain pens on it. The pocket in the back is nice. It's not quite big enough to store a full page of letter paper unfolded. Dot Grid allows me to use the page as needed without having to worry about being in or out of the lines.

If you're looking for a dot grid notebook, this is a very good option, as is the large.",4
"Tee-tiny notebooks for just the right occasion! They are super small so know what you are getting, pull out that ruler. But perfect for passwords or easy notes when needed.",4
I love the feel of this notebook. It sits flat when I'm using it and has a nice soft floppy cover. The pages are a little thinner than I'm used to though.,4
"Good for writing, though the paper does ghost when you use a fountain pen. I love these notebooks for keeping track of patients and notes because they fit perfectly in a white coat pocket.",4
works as planned,4
"I love the color of this, and the pocket is great. The dotting is nice too. I only wish that the paper was a tad thicker so that pens didn't show through on the other side. I haven't found a pen that doesn't ghost. I can live with it, but I would love this product if this issue wasn't present.",4
"I'm super thrilled that Moleskine is making dot grid notebooks in this size. Quality is typical for the brand. Could be better but that would likely increase the price. I honestly find my large sized dot grid notebook more usable but that's a reflection on preference, not quality. I also wish that they would go one size larger, as even more room would expand the usability of each sheet dramatically.",4
Small enough to fit in a pocket.,4
Like I said.,4
"I rated 4/5 because one of the 2 I received had crooked binding and was a little bit fugly. Kind of made it look cheap but thats the only problem, pretty slight, not a huge deal. I recommend it, super small.",4
Good item,4
"It has an alphabetized section to list your books by title, when you read them, and what you thought of them, an index in the back that you can fill in as you go along, and sections like ""Borrowed"" and ""Lent"", ""Wish List"", and best of all, a ""To Be Read"" section to keep track of your TBR pile in. This last is especially handy if the books you plan to read are scattered all over the house, office, and e-reader and not in one neat little pile next to your favorite chair!

It seems to be good-quality paper and well-bound, and it has several bookmarks sewn in.

I found the stickers to be sort of silly and superfluous.",4
"This is a good one that is similar to the ""Book Lust Journal.""  I was looking for a way to make notes while I was reading my books so that I had an outline for the book review when I was finished.  This book works out great for that.  It has great structure for book reviewing.",4
"I've always loved reading.  I can't remember not reading.  Like many, when I was young, I read certain authors, then certain genres.  But then I ran into a problem.  I was reading too fast for the good authors to keep up, and sometimes did not know what I wanted to read.  So I got myself a subscription to Entertainment Weekly, and used that plus emails from my local library to read book reviews to decide what to read.  I've gone through several spiral bound notebooks over the years, keeping a list of books to read.  Once I finished reading, I crossed the book off.  This served me well, or so I thought.

Why didn't I think of a book journal?  Why didn't I think of recording what I have read as well as what I want to read?  It simply never occurred to me.  Now I can keep a record of what I've read and if I can't remember an author's name, I can look in my journal.  D'Oh!  This is really useful!

It has different sections, and some I like and some I don't.  I'd like to have some ruled pages, for example.  The alphabetical index tabs are set up like an address book.  Every letter has the same amount of space.  I can overcome that, though.  In my address book, the ""W"" section always overflowed; I just put in ""see 'L'"" for more of that letter.  There are some stickers tucked in the back you can use if you want.  The most useful are for labeling tabs to personalize the functionality of the journal.  The outside cover is pretty decent, and the 3 ribbons are handy for flipping back and forth - you'll get what I mean when you buy yours.  Too big for a pocket, but still a handy size.

Moleskine offers more product - additional pages and dust jackets, etc. on their website.  They have a community, for heaven's sake, if you want to take it that far.

I am really glad I chose this item.  It isn't just useful to me.  I can let another book lover borrow it (in my presence, so I get it back!) so they can get some new reading ideas.",4
"Being a Gen Xer, I straddle the divide between the total luddites who distrust digital information and the younger generation that's probably comfortable with never turning pages.  I like the feel of paper books, but I also see the value in digital technology.

Anyway, I read a lot of non-fiction, mostly academic books for my day job as a law professor.  I tend not to like to write in my books, which becomes a problem for keeping track of useful parts of books that I might want to come back to as source references for my own academic writing.

The Moleskine Passions Book Journal is a pretty good solution to my dilemma.  It's got 154 pages with tab dividers by letters A-Z for taking notes on individual books, with another 75 pages of all purpose note space.  Each page lets you keep track of the title, author, publisher, date of publication, date read, and whatever notes you want to keep.

It's handsomely crafted, with a leather cover, page ribbons sewn into the binding, back cover folders for keeping little papers, and an attached rubber band for keeping the book closed.

The main drawback that I can see to this product is that taking notes on books that you've read has to be more efficient in a Word or Excel file on a computer -- you can take more notes, you can search for specific words, and so on.  I suppose you can take notes by hand first, then transfer them into a computer file later.  If you like being able to take notes without a computer, though, this is a nifty product.",4
"Nice wee note books, I need to pay closer attention to sizes.",4
"Not exactly what I expected.  I do like the note feature,  but for the price I would have liked a few more features.  I use it daily though and it is a moleskin so. It's quality.",4
"The notebook is good quality, the flexible soft covers make it easy to keep in a pocket, and the color is great. Moleskine notebooks are a bit pricey, but, in my humble opinion, well worth it.",4
Dots are too pale. Wish I'd gotten the quadrille or ruled. Good quality tho.n,4
Small but good,4
"Pretty cheaply made, the notebook has 3 sets of folded papers that are sewn in and held a bit poorly. It's a bit hard to open at first when breaking it in, but after a few days of use I'm able to hold it open comfortably. Overall, I'd rather purchase a larger moleskine with a better made spine for that price.",4
Exactly as described and shipped quickly,4
Great note book. Cool Evernote premium is cool as well as the integration and the stickers help with putting things where they go.  I just don't get why they're so expensive.,4
"There are many things that I like about this version of the Moleskin.
1. The three months of credit for evernote premium - which I have used for years
2. The size and feel is tremendous
3. Pages that can be removed from the book if needed
4. The tags, icons, etc are useless to me
5. Evernote camera app still needs work
6. Do not copy part at the bottom of the pages currently have no value to me",4
"I love these notebooks. I love to doodle--that's about all I can manage.(I wasn't gifted by being an arstist.) The front cover can be ""doodled"" on, as well as the inside front and back. The texture of the pages is almost silky--if you can imagine.lol Regular ballpoint pens glide over the page. I purchased them to be my Bible journal. It's the perfect size to fit inside the cover of my bible, or even in the pages. College ruled, which is my favorite. I recommend these to friends. I will purchase again!",4
Use this as a diary. pages are good sized and has a nice book mark. Only think I wish it had was the year on the cover.,4
"They're gorgeous and light and I'm very happy with my purchase. In fact, I bought these in red and I'm looking forward to them. However, these did arrive bent on one corner which was rather disappointing.",4
"I really love these Moleskine journals. I think the title of ""large"" is a little misleading, but they are still great. They fit perfectly in my purse are work wonderfully as a food journal.",4
I'm using the journal to consolidate most of the information contained on individual pieces of paper so I can locate it easier,4
"Accidentally purchased these instead of the ""Extra large"" variety that I use for note-taking in class, but I figured I would try them out. I use them for daily To-Do lists as well as jotting down other quick pieces of info. A little pricey for the size of the notebooks. Just be aware that these are tiny. I know the dimensions are listed but I was a fool and assumed ""Large"" meant bigger than this. Check the dimensions! They actually are quite small. Otherwise, great notebooks. Nice cover and paper, and a convenient little pocket in the back. No complaints are far as the notebooks themselves. I'm sure they're perfect if this is the size you are looking for.",4
"Have been using larger notebooks at work for years.  This is a good quality, small alternative.  I really like how the thin the cover is.

Only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't open as flat as other reviews led me to expect.",4
Love moleskine notebooks but they clearly come at a price. Worth it though.,4
Good notebook. Kind of expensive. If you are just taking notes for class I do not recommend this notebook unless your rich as all get out. I go through notebooks like toilet paper. If you take notes in class just get some reinforced college rulled paper and a 3 ring binder and your good.,4
"If you want to carry a pocket notebook that doesn't fall apart before it fills up, this might be the ticket. I'm on my second, it's almost full, and is only just now starting to disintegrate, even though I carry it in the back pocket of my jeans.

That said, what I'd really like is a pocket notebook with some extra space in the spine to fit a pencil. Hence 4 stars, not 5.",4
"Overrated, but looks classy on my desk. Would not repurchase. It's just okay, definitely nothing to get excited about. Would prefer more organization.",4
Was too small for what I had planned for this.,4
I love moleskine paper but I wish it would come in a white color.,4
"To me, the large hard bound plain moleskine is the classic. The softcover extra large is the natural evolution of the book. I really enjoy the extra landscape to write my thougts where I felt the large was just a tad small for true note taking.

Try it, the test alone is worth the money. It's a moleskine afterall...",4
"Easy, accessible, tiny journals for daily use.",4
"These little journals are a perfect size for your pocket at work. I wish I read that they don't have lines, but oh well. I also use one to jot down recipes.",4
Good for sketches and anything else where you don't need ruled pages.  The tear-out pages are a nice feature.,4
"This is a very unusual product and I would strongly encourage anyone considering getting one to be completely aware of what it is before they purchase it.  First, if you are looking for a single travel guide to prepare you for your trip to New York (or anywhere else there is a guide for), this is very close to worthless, if not entirely worthless.  I would call one's attention to the title of the product.  It is a ""Notebook.""  That means that most of the pages are blank.  This literally is a book for taking notes in.

So what do you get when you buy this?  Every book in the series follows the same format.  First there is a personal information page with address, phone, allergies, family doctor, passport number, then map information with public transportation maps. Then follows information on the various forms of transportation with phone numbers and websites, including cabs, buses, other forms of public transportation, and airports.  There are some blank itinerary pages, measurement and speed conversion charts, size conversion charts (for shoppers), then a long series of neighborhood maps, including an index.  And that's it.  The final two-thirds of the notebook are blank.  The next 20 or so pages are completely blank and unlined for whatever use you want to put them to.  Next come several pages intended for writing down names of restaurants, bars, museums, historical sites, hotels, or whatever.  The book also comes with unlabeled tabs with stickers to use as desired (for theaters, concert halls, or whatever you desire) as well as tracing paper for, as the label says, ""Itineraries or Whatever.""  Finally, there is the usual pocket at the back that is found in all Moleskine products.

For some people this is going to be an absolutely useless product.  But for many this will be remarkably useful.  In fact, I can envision two uses for this notebook.  First, those who are planning a trip to one of the places for which Moleskine has produced a book.  Let's say one has consulted the Blue guide, the Eyewitness Guide (by DK), a Rough Guide, the Michelin guide, and the Let's Go guide.  Maybe you've bought all of these, making for five guides.  No way do you want to drag all of these on your trip or more than one on your flight.  So what might you do?  You might take the Moleskin Notebook, record into it all the places you want to see, restaurants you want to dine at, museums you want to stroll through, and anything else you want to do while in your destination of choice, and record it there.  So the Moleskine City Notebook can serve as a distillation of all the various travel guides, web sites, and other resources you have consulted.  And instead of hauling about a large Fodor's guide, you can carry about this small Notebook that can easily fit into a backpack, purse, should bag, or even pocket.

The only downside is that the Moleskine City Notebook is only as good as you make it.  If you do a good job of planning your trip, it will be filled to the brim with useful and helpful information.  If not, it will be as unhelpful as you have made it.

There is a second use to which the City Notebook can be put to use, though it is not one for which it was primarily designed.  You could use it for the city in which you live, should you live in one of the cities for which one is made.  I live, for instance, in Chicago.  I have bought one of these so that I can over time use it to record every bit of helpful information that I might find useful or helpful.  I can record what hours the Seminary Co-Op Bookstore (the real one, not the trade version on 57th Street) is open.  The hours for the Chicago Public Library and the Newberry Library.  Phone numbers of restaurants and addresses of bars.  And so on and so forth.  Granted, these books will only benefit those who live in one of those cities, but for the U.S. New York, Chicago, Boston, Washington D.C., Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles are pretty populated areas.

So this is a very well conceived product though it absolutely has to be stressed that it is a specialized one.  Please note:  THIS ISN'T FOR EVERYONE.  If you don't want to use the Notebook to plan your trip it is going to be very close to worthless.  I'll emphasize again:  this is only as good a product as you make it.  But if you use it to help you plan your trip, it could be the single item you would most loathe to be without after your notebook.",4
"Yahoo!  The Moleskine people listened to the art community!  I had tried this watercolor book and reviewed it a while back, when it first came out.  I did not give it a good review because the paper was not at all watercolor-friendly, and that was a gross understatement.  The paper was thin and crinkly after a wash. I used only two pages, then relegated it to the pencil-only sketchbook pile. That was then.

NOW, this new version is much, much better.  It has 135lb paper, and it takes washes very well without crinkling like the old version.  I did a few watercolor sketches in it, and it held up quite well.  I am happy with it, because now, I get to take a MOLESKINE with me on outdoor treks.  (That Moleskine-cachet with never go away, -nor should it).",4
"At the time of writing this review, each notebook costs about $2.55, bundled in sets of 3. So why spend that much money, when you could get a memo pad for $0.75 at Wal-Mart? The answer is this: Moleskine produces the most consistent and convenient product for this size and type of notebook. The build quality is high, and the aesthetic is rustic and minimal. When you factor only price in, you miss the point of using a Moleskine.

Personally, I use this as my wallet and notepad. I keep my ID and credit cards in the back, and I use the pages for ideas, memos, or notes. The one I currently have in my pocket has held up for 15 months with a bit of tape to help it. I always get compliments and ""Ooh, that's cool"" comments when I take it out of my pocket. The Moleskine is not only a good notebook; it's basically a fashion or personality accessory in what it projects to others. If you're into writing, it's cool to have good supplies for it.

The Pros:
-The look and feel. New ones look serious. They have a cool shape, and the thread of the binding is a nice touch. Old ones look vintage.
-The size. The width and height are great dimensions for any pocket. And the thickness is easily bearable. When compared to my Galaxy smartphone, it is lighter and thinner, with only a few cm of excess around the sides.
-The flexibility. Since I keep this in my pocket, the flex helps it stay comfortable. The paper also makes it feel less sweaty than my cell phone.
-Page texture. I can write with any pen or pencil on the paper, and it feels great. From fountain pens to ballpoint pens, from regular #2 pencils to drawing leads.

The Cons:
-Ink bleeds through the pages. I use both sides anyway, but it may bother you if you like prisitine pages
-Cover sometimes needs tape to hold it together with heavy use.
-Perforated pages sometimes come loose at the tops and bottoms with heavy use.
-Cost. I could buy about 10 memo pads for the cost of 3 Moleskines.

Overall, this is a cool notebook. I use them a lot. And when I am looking for a cool gift for someone, but I don't know what they want, I usually get them a Moleskine, something cool to write with, and something they might like to read. I'd recommend at least trying these out to see what you think.",4
"These are a bit smaller than I was picturing when I ordered, so make sure you're looking closely at the measurements (I sadly, did not), and are flimsier than what you picture when you hear the Moleskine name. It feels like, for what you're getting, the price could be a bit better, but they're good little portable sketchbooks. I love having one in my bag to just jot notes down on as needed.",4
These are the bigger journals with blank pages. The product dimensions are correct as specified in the description. The covers are cardboard. The pages are manila/faded yellow and are thick enough not to allow bleeding with most pens. Their look and feel is great. There's also a pocket in the back of each cover. Worth their relatively high price.,4
"A great set of notebooks for the price. The quality of the paper is very nice and professional, and the soft-cover back is nice as well (flexible without leaving marks). My only complaint is that you can only tear out the last 6 or so pages, which is fine, but when you attempt to tear out any other pages that are not perforated then the outcome is pretty ugly. That's my only complaint with an otherwise great notebook.",4
This fit's great in the back pocket or backpack. I bring it with me to meetings and look very ready for any situation. This is good considering I'm a manager and aspire to grow within the company,4
Somehow the paper on this one isn't as good as the paper on the lined version (this one is the unlined).  The paper is softer somehow and more prone to tearing.,4
"I use these things for taking notes at work. They are small enough to fit in your pocket and be out of the way all while being big enough to take the notes I need to take and draw illustrations I need to share.

To me it is the perfects size notebook for all that I do. Try it! You'll see.",4
great notebook,4
"I searched for a long time for unlined notebooks that were not also sketchbooks. I considered purchasing Moleskinne's more expensive variants, but settled on these purely from a price standpoint. The quality difference is noticeable, but it really doesn't matter to me. The more expensive have a nice cover with a band that keeps the notebook shut. They also have more pages and just ""feel"" nicer. These notebooks, the cahier, sport a flimsier sleeve and lack the band. They also have fewer pages. The quality is without a doubt a cut below, and if that bothers you, you may want to go for the nicer model they offer. I really like the notebooks, though, and will buy more when I need them. If you want some decent unlined notebooks, you'll find them here, at a fairly reasonable price as well.",4
We bought these books for our daughters to journal during our recent vacation. It was nice that they had pockets in the back to store loose items until they could be taped in. They held up well and were a good size for them to carry around in their backpacks. I took off a star because the price was not super great - I saw similarly priced items locally after purchasing these.,4
I like Rhodia better,4
"Bought as part of a gift set for my niece's birthday.  She loves moleskin and she asked for watercolors this year, so I got 2 of these in different sizes to go with her kit. This larger size one seems really nice.  I am sure she will love it.",4
Far too expensive for the soft cover version. It is what I needed but the cost could be a lot lower.,4
It's a nice little landscape oriented book of watercolor paper. It looks nice and the paper itself is of decent quality. Worth the cost and travels well.,4
The great quality of Moleskine and fits well in your pocket.,4
"I really love this Moleskine Watercolor Journal! It's pretty great, I love the paper as well. It's really hardy.

The only thing I don't love is that somehow the cover has already warped slightly. Doesn't really detour from use, but it doesn't allow for flat pressing of the papers inside. Also the elastic has stretched already... I've only had it about a month.",4
"These are a great size as they fit in a coat or blazer pocket.  The cover is cardboard so it gives a little.  The paper is pretty heavy and I have not had any issues with ink going through.  Nice touch with the last few pages being perforated.  Best used as a travel book, looks a little cheap for business meetings.",4
"I have been a longtime fan of Moleskine products and when I spotted this bigger cousin of the traditional Moleskines I just had to try it. So I've been using it during the last year, have taken it to a lot of travels and it still has plenty of juice.

PROS
- As all other Moleskine products, binding quality is top notch (that alone justifies the higher price of Moleskines, I think); this notebook won't come apart in decades at least, no matter how rough you treat it.
- Soft cover: Being used to the hard cover of other Moleskines, I didn't like this at first sight. However, it has also endured the test of time and gives the notebook a very welcome flexibility I've come to appreciate. Its inner pocket still holds gracefully.
- Plenty of pages, due to the thinness of the paper of course.
- 7"" x 10"" is a nicer format than that of other Moleskines to work at: not too large, not too wide, and with plenty of room to doodle or explore concepts before you run out of space in a single page.

CONS
- As everyone else has said: The paper. Its wafer-thin quality means inks, markers, etc will always bleed and seep through the reverse side. This can happen with pencils too. However, this being a problem depends very much on how you plan on using the notebook. In my own case, I use this Moleskine for very rough, black-on-white pencil/rapidograph reference drafts and idea collections I later develop in digital form, so I don't care much about the paper tidiness (and its mess probably only makes sense to me anyway). I don't use colors.  However, the paper is not so thin as if you could accidentally tear it by means of strong drawing or erasing. If you are of the type who is more geared to create finished artwork straight into a notebook, you will definitely want a Moleskine with thicker paper than this one. For the use I give it to mine, it works.",4
"I have used Moleskines for a long time for journaling but have found, as I become more fascinated with mixed media journaling techniques, that I needed something with heavier paper. This is the answer. Beautiful, heavy weight watercolor paper that holds up to everything I have been able to throw on it!

I wish that Moleskine would make this paper available is a portrait format as well - but in the meantime I'm happy to work in a landscape format. For some reason I find this size to be perfect. It's easy enough to keep in your bag or brief case - not too large and not too small. A very convenient ""carry-with"" size....which I think is what many Moleskine users have found over the years.",4
Well worth the price!  they are well made; not expensive and not too bulky.  Perfect for anyone looking for a personal or business use journal.,4
"I am a fan of all notebooks and have used Moleskine for years. I like this size but have gone to a Midori system, so I just trimmed it down to fit the size I am using. I do feel the paper is a bit thinner than previous notebooks, so a felt tip and sharpie type pens do bleed through. These were a good price compared to what is available in the store.",4
"I bought this incorrectly thinking it was the squared version that has pages that are like engineering paper.  When I got it I realized it was just blank pages and then realized it was my fault for failing to read the description/title correctly.  I have since gotten the squared version (professional series though) and absolutely love it.  I use it to take daily notes and draw up diagrams/charts/tables etc.  I am an engineer and have found it is perfect for the types of things I do.

The notebook I eventually got was very similar to this one so I can review the similarities.  The notebook looks very nice and professional.  The pages are easy to write on and absorb ink pretty well.  The back of the book has a small pocket to put loose pages in.  The elastic strap around the front is really nice for keeping the pages secure and safe.  Also I really enjoy the ribbon that keeps me on the right page and I don't have to flip through the book looking for the last page I wrote on.  These are a little pricey but if you take a lot of notes and want to have something to keep you a little more organized I think these work great.",4
"These notebooks are a great size for all kinds of writing. Paper could be a bit better quality. My only wish would be for a hard cover version, like they do for the pocket and large sizes. The downer is price. They have become too expensive to even make sense for nostalgia freaks. Are you listening Amazon/Moleskine?",4
"I love Moleskine, but the pages are a tad too thin. Don't use Sharpie Pens",4
Very fast delivery. Very good product & seller. Thanks. A+++,4
"I have many of these as I haven't found a suitable replacement. The pages are a little thin, but it allows for more pages. But my pens bleed through. It has a pocket in the back, which I actually find myself using. And the notebook is flexible, which I love. Oh, and the pages fold flat, which is a must for me!

Things I wish Moleskine would add:
Slightly thicker pages
Page numbers and Table of Contents
Some graph paper in the back.
Pen loop

Then it'd be perfect!",4
"I love the quality of the papers, they feel soo smooth and are fun to draw on, but the paper is really yellow, so if you're not looking for a really yellow paper, don't buy this!! Other than the color, it's really good quality and the journal in general has a very professional look on the exterior.",4
"MY FAVORITE SKETCHBOOK. THIS IS MY THIRD ONE. The paper is smooth and thick. it is okay for a couple washes of watercolor and markers. the only bad thing is that the cover easily scratches and when you erase the paper, it discolors.",4
"I do like these notebooks, but I like the field notes better.",4
Delivered as advertised.,4
This was a trial and it's pretty good but still like a heavier paper.,4
These fit perfectly in my Chic Sparrow pocket notebook.,4
"more great products from moleskin, holds up well to some abuse",4
"The covers are thin, and they've ended up bowing out a bit, but this is much sturdier and more useful than other notebooks of the same size--except for Moleskine notebooks of the same size with hard covers.  Now, they're just superb.",4
"Lost a star due to price. They are nice quality books, but some drawing, coloring tools bleed thru pages. If you stick to pencils, colored ink pens and charcoal, you'll be fine. Does not like sharpies!!

Nice books but again pricey which will limit some people from trying them out.",4
An iconic classic. Great gift for the writer or sketcher in your life.,4
"First off-  these journals are tiny. Seriously. They're small in size and don't have a lot of pages. However, they're perfect to slip in your bag (clutch and all) for quick access to jot notes and as a bookmark to write thoughts from the book I'm currently reading. I decorate my covers with acrylic paint pens and they're perfect",4
I use these for keeping track of my health information and food nutritional information for Weight Watchers,4
I enjoyed this journal as my first Bullet Journal but I had to move to something spiral bound...I just don't like anything but spiral bound for journaling but even so I was content with this journal and it lasted a long time.,4
"Watch the page numbering. They seem to define a ""page"" as both sides of a sheet. Using Noodler's Heart of Darkness and still getting bleed through.",4
"Nice quality set of pocket notebooks, but super expensive. The outer cover is flimsier than I imagined, but there's a mini pocket on the inside of the back cover, which I thought was handy. The paper quality was also very good.",4
"I really enjoy this note book.. but i prefer the Leuchtturm simply because it has added page numbers, and table of contents, and at the top there is space to write the date.",4
Nice ruled and small enough to fit in a purse. I bought it for my tangle sketches but it is better just to use as notes since it is ruled and the paper is too smooth for sketching.,4
"These pocket notebooks are perfect for carrying always on one's person. It is the same size as a passport, and fits in a back pocket or shirt pocket (on male clothing, at least.)

The paper is smooth and accepts ink well, and the cover is sewn on, unlike some other notebooks that are stapled. I'm not sure how much difference this makes in longevity.

There is a pocket inside the back cover that doesn't quite along with the back cover, so the glue eventually fails and it just flops about, but it doesn't bother me enough to fix it yet with tape or glue.

UPDATE
I've gone through several of these now, and they hold up well. However, I think I'm moving on to a different type for two reasons:
1. the paper is quite thin. This makes it fit well in the pocket, but if I use a rollerball or fountain pen there's significant ghosting through to the other side.
2. there's slight feathering with the aforementioned inky pens

Minor quibbles:
1. very difficult to tell which side is the front when you pull it out of your pocket. I wrote in white paint-marker ""this side up"" on the cover, which I then varnished to prevent from rubbing onto my clothes.
2. I like dot-grid paper better than lined because it affords more flexibility for making tables and diagrams. Moleskine doesn't offer this.

My next pocket notebook will be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scout-Books-DIY-Lined-Notebook-12-Pack-3-5-x-5/dp/1937852377/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scout Books DIY Lined Notebook 12 Pack (3.5"" x 5"")</a>&nbsp;with the dot-grid pages. I hear their paper is quite good. Slightly cheaper, too, if you buy them by the dozen.",4
A quality product delivered when promised.,4
"As a new bartender, it was recommended that I purchase a little black book to store recipes in. It wasn't easy finding an address book w/out pre-printed pages, but this was pretty close. It fits my needs perfectly.",4
"I love this little notebook! Quality throughout, a total classic. I just wish it was made in USA. Maybe someday...",4
"These notebooks are a very handy size.  Unfortunately they're just about the same size as a passport, so if you plan to bring this notebook with you on a trip to foreign country, beware of that!  I got my notebook and passport confused a number of times.",4
As expected.,4
I have them on my night stand just in case I need to write down something while I'm already in bed and it's a perfect size,4
It is ok for small notekeeping but would recommend a cover to keep two or three of them together. because the individual notebook will be used out pretty quickly,4
"I love these multi-use Moleskin books as they are alphabet ordered and lined but not ""address book"" formatted.  Love the elastic band to keep it closed and the attached bookmark as well.  This only gets four stars however because the one I recieved had one manufacturing flaw: it was missing the plastic tab for the letter ""N"".  I expect more from Moleskin, especially as they are more expensive than other brands.  The book had the pages and spacing for the letter N, so I just wrote it in myself and will keep it.  It can be used for anything--I'm using mine to catalogue my crystal and mineral collection.  I have not had any problems with their products before and since they are the only ""address book"" I can find that is unformatted and can therefore be used for other purposes, I'm sure I will continue to use them.
Update: I found the letter ""N"" in between pages,  apparently, it just became unglued and fell off,  i have not had this problem with any other letters in this book or other Moleskin products.",4
"I love this journal! It was well worth the price. Neither the ink or highlighters bleed through the pages and what ever you write is well protected in the hard outer covers. It's a nice size and easy to mold, you don't have to constantly hold one side down while writing. Plus, it has a nice little pocket at the back of it. My only concern is how lose the pages are. I tested it out by gently tugging on a page while I was write and it started to tear from the thread. Other than that it's a very good journal and I plan on using everyday!",4
"I needed a small notebook that could fit in my chest pocket without adding bulk. The bigger 3x5 inch versions were too thick and tall with a very noticeable weight to them.

I use the notebook to write down tasks, quick notes for reports, and because each page is easily detachable, I can write quick messages and pass it off to co-workers. The work environment doesn't involve any computers and using a phone to check on messages isn't convenient where as a note can be quickly put somewhere in sight.

Although it is 54 pages, there is also much smaller writing space. I find I can usually go through each book in about 8 weeks so I keep a few extras around.",4
This is nice. But it doesn't prevent ink leaking very well. The ink can actually penetrate pages.,4
"If you're looking for a tough book to carry around to jot down thoughts and other notes, this is it.",4
"Paper is very thin but other than that, is pleasant.  Expensive compared to other options, too, some of which are maybe as good.",4
This particular Moleskine Classic Notebook is a favorite product of mine and has been every since beginning to Bullet Journal.  While I wish I could offer it a higher quality review the biggest problem that I have faced with it is the fact that by using any type of regular pen (Not Sharpies or any other type of similar pen) there is always problem with bleeding on other pages.  The only guaranteed way of preventing bleeding through the pages is to write in Mechanical Pencil which is not the best way or practical way of keeping track of your notes or appointments in this notebook. I have included a picture sample of the issues you will encounter.,4
"Just a heads up for those of you who need a specific number of pages in a notebook: Moleskine reports page numbers for their notebooks like you would number the pages of a book instead of normal notebook makers who give you the physical number of pages in the notebook.

Just a warning.",4
"I've never had a Moleskine I didn't like.  This one's great for carrying around for shopping lists, quick notes, etc.",4
"This is my first Moleskine notebook. Maybe I don't ""get it"" but what I see is a fairly robust notebook with good-quality quadrille paper. The bookmark is a nice touch, a better one is the elastic closure which goes a long way to preventing in-pocket damage. This package is nice, but it ain't so nice I'd pay top dollar for it.

As for the pocket, I'd have been happier (so happy I wouldn't carp at the price) if it had been a spine pocket with a small flanged pencil in it, like diaries of my childhood used to have, so that when the urge or need to write came upon me I wouldn't have to look for something to write *with* as well as something to write on.

I don't think I'll be making Moleskine a big part of my portable life on the strength of this admittedly well-though-out item. With some sort of provision for carrying a writing implement that wouldn't be the case.",4
"This little ""pocket"" squared book is great. I love the softbound cover, the elastic closure, the little secret pocket inside, where you can keep a couple photos or something else of interest. The cloth bookmark is also quite helpful for keeping my place. The binding is stitched well and it stays open and flat with ease. The only thing I would like is to see the Whitelines brand with something like this. The paper in this book is yellowish with dramatic, dark lines. The quality is good, but I would love to have something like this with the slightly gray paper and white lines around the squares. That would be incredible. This is still a great book though and I would highly recommend it. :)",4
Great price.,4
"These notebooks are classic and reliable.  The Squared version is even less compatible with fountain pen or gel ink than the Ruled or Plain versions, however.  Plan to use this with pencil or ballpoint.",4
"nice notebook, writes well",4
"Product was as advertised, quality seems good.",4
"I am unsure if it is the lot number or what, but the lines on these were a lot lighter than the ones I purchased at an office supply store. But a fantastic value for what I paid. I saved almost 45% buying these through Amazon",4
Every story and book about Corduroy is Fantastic. This book is great and I bought all the Corduroy books for my 2 boys and now for their total of 5 children. You have to buy a Corduroy bear for everyone who has the books. Love to hold them while the stories are read.,5
"I purchased this book for my first grade classroom. I read the book to the students during a math lesson. The first day, I split the students into groups and had them count how many pockets they had all together. They recorded it on a chart and answered questions like: Who had the most? Who had the least? Choose two numbers and compare using <,>,=. The second day we referenced the book and compared pockets of the boys vs the girls. They again answered questions about the numbers. They loved it! Recommend!!",5
"Having spent numerous years in an elementary school library, I can say with all honesty that the Corduroy books were great favorites for all the years I was there. A Pocket for Corduroy is a charming addition to anyone's collection. It is a very sweet story about the owner of Corduroy who leaves him in the laundry and has some difficulties retrieving him. Children can relate to that quite well. Getting him back is a good lesson in itself. Sewing the pocket on for him is delightful. It has a happy ending which is most enjoyable. Further note, when I read the Corduroy books to little people, I always tried to have an example of corduroy material with me - either on as pants, etc. Some of the children did not know what corduroy was. Five star book",5
Corduroy gets a pocket....riveting stuff people.,5
Love this book,5
"Time
ESA, delightful children's book.  My granddaughter loves this book!",5
"This is a lovely gentle simple story of love and friendship.  It brought a smile and tears to my eyes.  Even though I am an adult, a friend read it out loud to me before giving the book to her teen-age daughter who had asked for it specially.  Just the perfect story for reading out loud.  Try it!  It's a special experience.",5

"These Bible Book Covers make great covers for Boy Scout Handbooks.

The Medium in particular has several extra pockets on the front for scouting doodads.

My son uses the Medium - perfect size for even the ring bound version of the handbook (highly recommend the ring bound over the perfect bound for handbooks - spend the extra dollar or two) - and far preferable (to us) to the velcro closure BSA one (that doesn't have room for much else either).

My son thought, from pictures, that the handle was sissy (you know, purse), but he wouldn't have it without it now (it's a book pack right?)

These are also thicker so there's room - and a left side flap - for a notepad as well as every Scout should have.

These do come in sizes, and Amazon has all three, though from confusing inconsistent entries. So do get the Medium for the Boy Scout Handbook. I bought to try the XL before finding the other sizes. It's pretty big - but I'm a Scout Master - and have already stuffed it with the extra handbooks and field books a leader may use. Recommendation in general for Scouts - Medium.

This was a gift for my nephew. It was in great condition. Very colorful. Great for the Hardcover Adventure Bible.,5
"This is a great little Bible cover for my son. I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews, but it's great. I'm glad we gave it a try. It's been dropped a few times already and is still in perfect shape.",5
"Good, sturdy Adventure Bible cover.  Thanks",5
"We purchased this case for my son's Webelo scout book. It's perfect and I'm glad we opted for this case rather than the case offered in that scout store. Pro's: it's army green, has extra pockets on the outside, a carabiner with a compass (that doesn't work properly but looks cool to the user, so I'm happy, and a nice handle.

On the inside, the case is just as nice. It has pockets to hold the cover of the book, of course, but also pencil loops which I am particularly happy about.

Great case.",5
"I am always on the lookout for cool products that also have a practical usage.  My son goes on a lot of Boy Scout campouts.  The boys are always bringing their scout handbooks so they can record and get signed off their new accomplishments.  However all the boys are hard on their handbooks and the notebooks they carry too.  I saw the Zondervan book cover and thought it would be good for a smaller notebook and his Boy Scout handbook, along with some pens/pencils/etc..  I ordered the Zondervan book cover and thanks to Amazon Prime, it only took two days for it to arrive.

The Zondervan book cover is very well made.  It holds the scout handbook in either the front pocket or the inside pocket.  It looks very ""scout-like"" with the greenish color.  The compass is cheap but it actually works! Nice addition!

Overall I feel the Zondervan book cover is a great value.

Love this blue bilbe cover and it goes along with his bible so nicely.  Love the idea of the pockets and the carry handle my son carried it to church for a while it even had room for his kindle fire to go in it.,5
This is PERFECT for my son's Boy Scout handbook. Holds pencil/pens and small notepad-great!,5
I bought this cover for my 10 year old girl.  She really liked it! Her Bible fits perfectly and we made a cute journal notebook to take with it.  Very pleased.,5
"It's a pretty nice bible cover.  My grandson loves it.  It's canvas, has a few extra pockets and a little compass.",5
Terrific. Fits medium size Bible. Lots of pockets.,5
My kiddo love his bible case! Good quality.,5
"This is a quality made Bible case, I had bought a cheaper camo one and the zipper broke within a week.  This case is very durable and the zipper is thick and tough.  The extra pockets and compass are very handy bonus. This fits my son's NKJV Bible perfectly.",5
"7 year old loves this cover, it's sturdy and fits his adventure bible NIrV great",5
"I purchased this for my son's Boy Scout book with spiral binding and it fits inside just right. There is also a bit of extra room to put a small notebook/planner/phonebook type booklet inside with it. It zips shut and then on the front there are a bunch of various sized pockets to store various items. My son can keep pens, a small bottle of hand sanitize, his pocket knife, some band aides and a few other things in these pockets so that he is prepared at troop meetings. The color also blends well with his uniform and he has gotten a lot of compliments from other boys and parents. The mom bonus for me is that his book isn't all dirty and falling apart like some of the other boys books! I found out quickly that the boys bring them but often toss them around, or if they see them laying around they have no problem stepping on them while running around playing. Even the older boys that should known better. For some reason they do this will plain books but not with bags or covered books so this helps to protect the book from him and the other boys!",5
Perfect for Webelos Scout Book.  Was able to embroider name on large flap on front.,5
"Great scout book cover.  I get a lot of compliments and questions about this because it is much better than the standard Scout Book covers.  It's great quality and the compartments make it easy to carry more stuff (pens, notpad, flash drive, etc.)",5
Best book carrier/cover/case that I could have ever bought for my 11 year old boy scout...Thanks!,5
"Our Daughter is a volunteer minister, so we got this bag to hold her Bible (bookcover included) and Bible based literature. It also holds a pen, highlighter and a notepad - all of which are included. The ""leather"" on the bag seems easy to keep clean, but the light pink could show soil marks, easily. It is canvas. The handles seem sturdy. This bag has been used for a couple of weeks of daily use without problem. The zipper pulls have attached metal crosses, but other than that there are no emblems, idols, symbols or brands visible.",5
"It looks great, is the perfect size, and is sturdy without looking or feeling big and klunky. It comes with a highlighter which was a nice surprise, along with room for some accessories such as one of my devotional books. The internal sleeve holds my large print bible with no trouble. This is a great product and feels as if it will last for years.",5
"I loved this bag; it fits my phone, bible, notebook, pen, highlighters, Apocrypha",5
"I got this bag to go with My mother new Giant Print Sword Bible. It goes great with it alongside with her markers, pens and papers. Very nice",5
"Really nice. I bought this organizer for my ""The Word"" Bible. There is a bible cover on the inside that is detachable so you can to take the bible out to use it. There are 3 large pockets for storage, 3 holders for pens and highlighter (1 of each included) and a sleeve that fits my Samsung 7.9"" tablet (nice). FYI - it is quite large when opened up so it is not convenient to take to church but still a great organizer.",5
Such a treat to be able to fit everything from the bible to my notebook and papers from classes in this organizer.  Extremely durable and with the shoulder strap it makes it easy to carry.,5
"I absolutely love this organizer! I've never had one before & figured I wanted to buy newer bible study items, now that I'm getting back on track with my relationship with the Lord. This organizer comes with a lot more than I thought it would! It comes with pockets to hold your Bible, a note pad, a pen, a highlighter, & a strap if you want to wear it on your shoulder. I was expecting the bag to be bigger, but it's not & I'm glad! You can even carry it like a regular purse!

I highly recommend!",5
Perfect!,5
son loves!,5
I recently bought a New Inductive Study Bible (ESV). The dimensions made it hard until I found this cover. It arrived today. The quality is top notch and the measurements are exactly as described. It is an XL case. I read a review that complains about the dimensions being different. It could be they received a medium and not an XL. I love it and will do business with these folks again.,5
I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it.  It's a rich olive green color.  The material is durable.  My daughter loves it because its not the typical bible cover.,5
Got this for a family member going into the military.  This one was nicely put together and the person I gave it to liked it. It held the Bible well. I'd buy one again.,5

My son uses the Medium - perfect size for even the ring bound version of the handbook (highly recommend the ring bound over the perfect bound for handbooks - spend the extra dollar or two) - and far preferable (to us) to the velcro closure BSA one (that doesn't have room for much else either).

My son thought, from pictures, that the handle was sissy (you know, purse), but he wouldn't have it without it now (it's a book pack right?)

These are also thicker so there's room - and a left side flap - for a notepad as well as every Scout should have.

These do come in sizes, and Amazon has all three, though from confusing inconsistent entries. So do get the Medium for the Boy Scout Handbook. I bought to try the XL before finding the other sizes. It's pretty big - but I'm a Scout Master - and have already stuffed it with the extra handbooks and field books a leader may use. Recommendation in general for Scouts - Medium.

Big enough and sturdy enough for my ESV study Bible. I like it!,5
"Nice large cover, bought it to cover a very large ESV study bible&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-ESV-Study-Bible/dp/1433502410/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The ESV Study Bible</a>&nbsp;and it works great. Tried several other covers and they wouldn't fit.",5
"I walked through the pouring rain one Sunday, to discover that the cover protected my Urantia Book, William Sadler's definition book, my notebook and timer. Nothing was even damp. Great product.",5
Really nice book cover.  Bought it for a large study bible.  Fits the book perfectly and the cover is very well made.  So far very happy with it!,5
"Handsome Bible cover, thick, strong, durable.  Best Bible jacket I have ever owned.",5
"As represented. VERY Nice, Sturdy & lots of room. HD all around.",5
awesome for a medium size bible,5
I was worried when I ordered this case for my Bible (Letra Super Gigante) but felt much better once opening the package. It is darker and more rich in color than it appears to be in the picture. It fit the Bible perfectly.,5
"This is a very good Bible carrier for our large print Bible. We were afraid it would not be big enough, but it is exactly the right size.",5
"I recently got the Complete-Evangelical-Parallel-Bible-International, which has 4 versions of the Bible, and it fits in this case. What more can I say than that it does its job?",5
"I bought this for the Hendrickson Parallel Bible-PR-KJV/NKJV/NIV/NLT Hardcover (reviewed separately).  It fits perfectly, snug but not tight.  Zipper works good. Material is faux leather or pleather?  Minimal, so don't expect to have room for a set of highlighters or to put your touchpad device in with the book.  Came well padded and protected along with other items in box.",5
"I will use this in my ministry to hold bibles and Bible literature. You receive a zippered case with handles, Bible cover, long strap, a pad, a pen, and a highlighter. I was only looking for a Bible Cover for my Hindi BSI (OV). The price for this whole set was fabpriceulous, as many covers alone were the price of this set! I ordered 3 colors: Black, Green, and Pink. I am happy with my purchase. I feel that this is sturdy enough to endure daily use. The front pocket of the bag is perfect for either a small notebook or even the small tracts and handbills that I will use. Inside the bag are extending cloth pockets and attachments to attach the Bible cover inside the bag itself. The strap can be used on either the Bible cover or the bag. I had thoroughly examined the pictures of this bag, I thought - but I hadn't noticed the metal ""Cross"" zipper pulls. They were on all 3 bags that I purchased.
I DO like that the bag, though.",5
"wonderful bible study bag. has plenty of room for study notes, a notebook, and the pocket on front is perfect for my keys and phone. I also like the fact that the bible case is removable. great features. yes it is large, but for study it's perfect for me. highly recommend and have a friend who bought one just like mine because she loved it so much.",5
"This is an Extra-Large Bible cover. It has a section inside that you can slip your bible into, and this section closes with a clasp, which is very important because that keeps your bible from getting all wrinkled and squished. But it's much larger than the size of a bible. It's so roomy that it can hold all my little notebooks and pens, and I have a alot of stationery that was making my old bible cover bulge out. I really, really love my new bible cover! One million stars.",5
"For it's compact size this little ""handbag"" can pack a whole lot of things. I use it for my bible. I can store pens and a few 1/2 inch books along with a workbook and/or notebook. I bought the black one and I love it!

There is an area to place the bible that is much like a book cover that is firmly attached to the ""bag"". You can fully unzip and open your book without taking it out. Great feature for quicker easy pack up and go. The outer cover is stiff and keep its overall shape. The small pocket in front fish mouths a bit for lumpier items and the handles are sturdy.",5
"So glad I ordered this!  It carries everything I need, bible, notebook, reading glasses, pens! : )  I can even slide my phone in the front pocket! : )",5
"This is a gorgeous Bible cover.  I read all of the reviews and wondered if it would look cheap.  I didn't expect it to be real leather for the price.  I love it.  And it fits my NIV Bible perfectly well.  This will save wear and tear on the Bible, and that was my goal.",5
good product,5
"I love it, I love it. perfect fit for my large Bible and it's so very attractive.",5
Was a present.,5
Nice and roomy. It needs more pockets for prns etc. very attractive.,5
I use it daily,5
It is very nice,5
Met my expectations.  The only thing I would like better is an outside pocket for quick access to notes.,5
"This is very handsome and holds my Thompson Chain Reference bible, which is large, very nicely.  A super great deal.",5
"Bought as a gift, my prayer warrior loved it!",5
"my boss loved this gift, very nice and a little larger than I thought.",5
"Of five Bible covers I bought, this is my second favorite.",5
"The price was so reasonable, it's beautiful and it arrived quickly  I would recommend this item to all who wish to protect their Bibles or books.",5
"Great fitting and well worth the money.
Well made and very roomy for the bible as well as ink pens and a tablet.",5
"Love Love, this Bible cover.  The ladies at church were wanting to know where I got it......My favorite feature is, I can close and not worry about zipping....I used the fob and attached it to the zipper to make it much easier to zip up...  My other cover had the handle in the binder edge...not good..... Nice and roomy....Couldn't ask for anything more...",5
Rented textbook,5
good,5
great condition.,5
It was a required book for my son in college.  He got an A in the course - I don't know if it was because of the professor or book.  We would have rented it if the price would have been right.  This was priced right and he was able to resell it and recover a lot of our purchase price.,5
"Great Book , loved it.",5
I have used this calendar everyday of the school year.  It has held up well and is part of my morning routine. Quick delivery. Good product.,5
love it,5
excellent working like new still from the day it was purchase up on till now.. recommend to others.,5
"Great calendar! For all the other reviewers complaining that it's flimsy...why would you buy this to use WITHOUT laminating it? It would be nearly impossible to interchange numbers and words without laminating it...any calendar would be that way. It cost me about $30 to laminate this at Kinkos. My preschooler loves it (we home school), and has fun doing the numbers and words each day. It's cute, colorful, and I love all of the pieces it came with. We use the clear back sticky velcro to interchange the pieces.",5
Thank you!,5
as described,5
"I have a 4yr old little boy that LOVES preschool, so I set up a little preschool in his room. Every morning before school he looks out his window to see the weather and makes sure his weather chart is set for the day. He loves it.....",5
Good product,5
"Bought these for my kids play room, they are a great size so they can see it, i thought they were going to be small buy i was wrong and they are on good laminated paper love them!",5
Great Peppa story,5
My daughter loves the Peppa Pig books. They often follow episodes she's seen and they're easy to read out loud. The wording is simple enough for an early reader to figure out and they're good learning books.,5
great product,5
Is a Christmas gift. So can't leave product usage feedback. Book in good shape,5
"This Peppa book is great, just like an episode of the show. My 4yo LOVES this pig and enjoyed every page. Great colorful pictures.",5
As expected!,5
"Kid loves peppa and reading, what can I say?",5
"read it at bedtime, read it at lunch, read it aloud, to a bunch.....of kids.",5

"So cute, great book.  Bought for a 3 year old's birthday, she loves Peppa!",5
My little 4 year old cousin is obsessed with Peppa Pig and this was the absolute perfect book to go with her Peppa Pig pjs. It's a very short read and highlights her most favorite characters.,5

My niece loves her book it her  favorite character ,5
My niece Love her book,5
Happy little 3 yr old with her Peppa books,5
granddaughter is a serious Peppa fan and loves all of her Peppa books...,5
"My daughter loves Peppa Pig. This story is cute, not a fantastic story like the classics but hey, it's a good bed time story. The language is written a little different than what I'm used to (it's British of course) but I have fun reading it in an accent for her!",5
My daughter is a huge Peppa Pig fan. We've seen this episode so she was familiar with the story. It follows the typical Peppa Pig episode format and isn't a GREAT story but it'll keep your preschooler entertained.,5
WONDERFUL,5
Love Peppa!,5
a gift and she loved it,5
a gift and she loved it,5
"My niece loves Peppa Pig and loves to swim, so got this fun little book for her to enjoy over the summer.  Peppa and George look pretty cute swimming.  Like the arm floaters.  These are upbeat little books which go with the TV series.  The price is great on these books, too.  A lot of bang for the buck.",5
Awesome,5
thank you,5
Perfect addition to our at home library!,5
Love it.,5
"I bought this book for my niece as she is a big PEPPA PIG fan.  Also got her a PEPPA PIG stuffed toy to accompany this story about bedtime for Peppa.  My niece and her parents watch PEPPA on television, and didn't know that PEPPA is in books, too!  So, this was a fun surprise fifth birthday present for my niece.  My brother says they will be re-reading this story many times.",5
"Oh Peppa Books, how do I love thee....let me count the ways!
1. You are a quick read before bedtime to a tired toddler
2. You are so reasonably priced, I can buy several and not wind up reading the same book over and over
3. Because you are priced so reasonably, I can purchase you for other toddlers as well",5
grandson loves it.,5
My girls love be Peppa Pig and they love this bedtime story :),5
These books are fun,5
"My daughter loves it, 3 yrs old",5
I read this book every night to my daughter at bedtime.,5
Cute story for a 2 year old Peppa fan,5
My 9 yr old daughter screamed when she opened this up for Christmas! This book has all the background information and details on all of the current Ever After High characters? The pages are in color.,5
Granddaughter loves the book.,5
Granddaughter loves the book.,5
Great for toddlers,5
My son and I LOVE Peppa Pig so he enjoys these books! (So do I!),5
Cute book.,5
"Our 2 year old girl really loves this book! She doesn't watch the show often, but loves pointing out all the characters and saying goodnight to Peppa and George.",5
Great book for my 4 and 2 year old kids,5
We love Peppa Pig!,5
My daughter loves Peppa Pig and this book is so cute and fun!  We read it every night at bedtime.  My only complaint is that it's not available in hardcover with thicker pages.  Ours is a little wrinkled now because it's so well-loved.,5
A bedtime favorite - everyone loves Peppa.,5
Cute quick read for the little ones.,5
My 3 year old is a huge Peppa Pip Fan! Very cute book!!,5
My daughter loves it. Enough said.,5
"It is not laminated, but it has a shiny finish to it.  I love the fact that it has the numbers highlighted in different colors. I got this one along with the Dr. Seuss Package to teach our kid and decorate the play room.",5
"If you look at the color patterns, you'll see how this is designed to help kids count by 2s, 5s, and 10s. I really like it.",5
"I got this book for my 8 year old for Christmas. She reads this one and the other Ever After High book I bought her all the time. She loves to climb into bed with me and read me a few pages, telling me about her favorite characters, and pointing out the beautiful fun illustrations. She takes this and the other one back and forth to school and right now they are her favorite books. Great reading investment!",5
Got this for my daughter getting honor roll the first 6 weeks at school. She loves it and takes it everywhere trying to teach me about the characters! She is 12. I actually like it myself!,5
"This yearbook is really cool.  I bought two for each of my daughter's and it showed sneak peeks of new characters coming out and there are scenes at the bottom of the pages. It gives you a history for each character.  It is softsided though.  Might have liked it if it was hardcover.  But, art work is great.  Overall, very pleased and the price is right!!",5
"This set makes putting up my classroom word wall a snap! The cards are large enough to read, but still small enough to fit well without taking up too much wall space.",5
You get a lot for you money with this poster package. It is from high quality paper stock and the printing is bold enough to be seen from all points in the classroom. I would recommend it to other teachers who need place value posters.,5
"Bright and colorful, easy to read, and big enough to see from across small room.",5
I purchased this for my classroom. This is my second year using it. I laminated it just to ensure its durability. I don't have any real complaints.,5
This is colorful as described in the picture and  large enough to hang around one wall in a standard size classroom,5
"This is a wonderful set for my middle school RSP students. I love that it has the common squares and common fractions. The kids still struggle with place values less than 1, so it's been a great help.",5
They look great around the bulletin board.,5
I can't believe the difference this grass made in the classroom. It's jut fun and bright.,5
These look amazing in my classroom,5
the item is great. Thank you!,5
Perfect to do a huge board!,5
My wife bought this for her Kindergarten class.,5
"This is a very large, very awesome calender!",5
Good product,5
excellent working like new still from the day it was purchase up on till now.. recommend to others.,5
Awesome,5
Great attention getters. Perfect for younger students,5
great product,5
"My 10 year granddaughter loves playing school at home with her friends.  She didn't ""need"" these, but boy did it add to her play-classroom fun!",5
I purchased these for my daughter to use in her 1st grade class.  She loves them and says they work great for getting her students attention.,5
"This is very helpful for all students at all ages!

Thank you

"I bought these for my kids who play ""teacher"" all the time. They love these and have lots of fun with them.",5
"I used this in years past and remember liking it. I ordered a new one and it's exactly how I remember! I also like that you can use dry erase markers on the pages having the children ""find"" the letters. Nice product!",5
I use this with my Kindergarteners as we learn the letters of the alphabet.  Oh how they love these songs!  I love how the flip chart is glossy and allows them to circle letters and after I can easily wipe it off.  The pictures are a great add to the songs.  Great purchase!,5
My students love the Songs on this ABC FLIP CHART  and requested it on a daily basis.,5
kids love it,5
This is a great flip chart for preschoolers learning their ABC's. I love the CD that accompanies the flip chart. The songs are unique and catchy...but don't count on your kids remembering them...they're too unique. Great way to have the kids point out the focused upon letter after the song - lower and upper case. Highly recommend.,5
"I ordered the ABC Sing-Along Flip Chart & CD for my five year old preschool classroom to use at the beginning of each new letter of the week. The songs are not at all cheesy and the kids even try to sing along with it even though the songs can be kind of fast. The song follows the words on the chart and repeats the words twice. The first time I used this I had each child come up and make a circle with a dry erase marker around the letter we were learning about. That was a long process in which I would not recommend unless you have a small class size or impeccably well behaved children. lol. The next week we did the song and talked about the letter, but this time I added the chart as an activity during center time. The kids LOVED having this choice during centers. Not only does this chart teach about letters, but you can also use it as a fine motor and handwriting tool as well. I would completely recommend!",5
"I have a one year old grandson and while I know he is to young to really appreciate this product I have to say, he loves it.  It works great on his fine motor skills and on learning which way the letters should go.  I feel it is really teaching him quickly and look forward to many many days of playing with it.",5
my granddaughter has used this for endless fun,5
This was the product I was looking for to use in my small groups. It is big enough to see but small enough to be portable.,5
"Does the job.  It is big enough for my purposes and the fold flat or fold and stand is great. And I can turn it on it's side or lay it down, opened up and there is a lot of surface to work with.  Being two sided is also a net feature.",5
"I can't say enough about this product. I home school my son and this product has been a lifesaver. I do have a full size white board hanging on the wall as well. This is still the board of choice. Its so easy. It stays open in triangle formation with Velcro at the bottom so it stays open very well. When your done undo the Velcro and it folds flat to store easily. I keep it right at the desk so its perfect for any concept you may be trying to explain quickly where the whole wall board is  not really necessary. This is double sided also. Both sides are white boards and both sides are magnetic !! it can be in the middle of  two students and both can use it at the same time without seeing the others work. The board wipes fairly easy but even better if you use some Expo (white board care Cleaner) . Then everything comes right off. I would definitely recommend their product. The price is also very very fair . These white boards , especially magnetic ones, can get pretty pricey.",5
"Works very well.  I bought this along with magnetic pictures to make a schedule for special needs child.
They work very well together.  Large, easy to use and set up.
I use at home, but would work well in classroom too.",5
Perfect. Flexible yet sturdy. Great teaching tool.,5
"This is a must have for all teachers. Mine gets borrowed all the time. It's awesome! The white board doesn't erase perfectly, but I make it work. I love that it is magnetic.",5
Well made. Can't wait to give to my grandbaby,5
Cure and works well with markers.  Magnets don't stick very well.,5
The children love using this at center time it sits on the table and wipes clean with dry erase eraser or paper towel if using the markers. My children write on one side and use the magnetic letters or numbers on the other side. I would recommend it.,5
This is a great way to let my granddaughter play with her alphabet magnets without being in the way in the kitchen.  She can sit and use her board and still be close to the action.  Helpful useful addition.,5
Lays flat for easy storage. Thanks!,5
"Wonderful little magnetic board, and very strong !!!! A wonderful value !",5
this is great,5
"These are a classroom favorite.  Being magnetic and being able to use dry erase markers has made them very versatile.  This has been such a popular item with my students - one that they choose when they have free time - that I've had to use clear packing tape to secure the top of both.  They've lasted a long time, and they are a vital part of what we do.",5
"I seriously don't know how I got along without it before! I am a teacher and I bought it for my guided reading/guided math table. I love that it is magnetic - I don't have a magnetic whiteboard or really anything magnetic in my entire room (except my filing cabinet) so that was a nice plus. From the pictures it looks like it is metal - it's not metal. It's actually sturdy cardboard with a coating over it. I don't plan on letting my kids use it, so the quality for me isn't an issue. All the colors I've used so far wipes off well - the colored expo markers leave a slight residue but they wipe off with a moist towelette. I also like that I can use both sides. I would definitely recommend this product!",5
"We had purchased Melissa & Doug magnets & had some made & went looking for a board.  THIS IS IT!  It is so reasonable and has been in use ever since we received it.  You can spell words, put the Leap Frog base on it to put in letters/animals, numbers, etc.  It is also double sided.  Even though it's not intended they also like to put things under/inside the board.  They can roll things through it.  Highly recommend & every child should have one to put their magnets on.",5
great,5
great little journal,5
good!,5
Great for starter poetry books,5
great for daily pre-diary and other notes,5
"This little notebook is pretty and very useful. It is purse-size, so you can keep It with you at all times.",5
"This is a lovely, simple little blank book, and a very good buy.  We use these books for piano lessons and school assignments.  They make terrific stocking stuffers, too.
Silly, though, to have sample pages for this product, since they are ALL blank.",5
"Very pretty and colorful!  They were smaller then I thought they would be, but are perfect to put in your handbag or tote bag.  I bought one for myself and my sister (we both love butterflies) and we both carry them in our handbags.  It has come in handy when I need to write something down while I am out of the house. I am going to buy a couple more to keep in the house and as back up for the one in my handbag.",5
"Very pretty small paperback notebook, perfect for sliding into a purse pocket.",5
Love this little book. Does not fall apart.,5
"This is the perfect little notebook to keep in your purse - I often find myself searching for a piece of scrap paper when I need to jot down an address or phone number (as my memory is awful!) so i I usually have to make do with the back of a recipt. Clearly, having an actual notebook is far preferred!

This notebook is very cute, with colorful butterflies on the front and back cover. As a added bonus, it also provides a reference guide which tells you what kind of butterflies it depicts.

Overall, this is a great product and a wonderful value!",5
Super cute! and super small. No lines on the pages and I think any young girl would be pleased to carry this in her purse. Must find a good pen to complete this ensemble.,5
It wasn't quite as big as I would have liked bit it was a great gift for the person I gave it to,5
Great,5
"As I read the reviews of this product I am very surprised because it is exactly as the description described. They are small, but I think it would be great for any purse. However, I bought them small to fit in a shoe box for a girl for Operation Christmas Child.",5
"Such a beautiful and small notebook, the butterflies are wonderful and you can toss this in your bag",5
I like to carry a small notebook in my bag. These are the perfect size.,5
Great gift!!!,5
Great for starter poetry books,5
Cute tiny little books to keep notes in like passwords to websites you don't often need to visit.  Just in case you are not home or don't have access to internet via mobile.,5
Very worthy,5
Thank you,5
Cute notebook!,5
"Really pretty notebook, seems durable.",5
"This is a very small book, but it's nice for taking notes or as a grab bag/ party gift.",5
My granddaughters love butterflies and love having pretty notebooks.  These are nicely made little notebooks. Pretty covers and the girls love them.,5
"I bought it as a cart stuffer. cause my wife thought it was cute. It's paper that you write on and it works for that purpose. Does not work as a remote-control, or any other electronic device.",5
I was so happy to get this little book. It is so cute and easy to put in your purse for little notes or phone numbers. Over all I would by it again.,5
The price on this was amazing and it is just a cute little notebook for leaving by the phone or anywhere you need to jot something down.  Perfect pocket size for taking shopping.,5
"The reason I purchased this notebook (more aptly called a notepad) was its cover. Specifically I planned to separate it from its signature and use it in a collage art journal project. If you are interested in the cover for an art project or otherwise, there are a couple things to note:

* The front/back covers are glossy
* In the upper right of the front cover there is a small, yet noticeable ""green edition"" logo (this may not be the case for every pad, just note it's possible you may snag one)
* The barcode and company blurb are poorly placed on the back cover and obscure an entire butterfly
* As a nice touch, the inside back cover notes the artist along with a rundown of each of the butterflies depicted

Beyond that, there are a few other notes:

* The binding is glued, not sewn so it doesn't open flat unless you coax it to
* This is a thin, though not overly scant pad of paper (30 sheets/60 pages)
* Its measurements are similar to a standard postcard (just shy of 5.75"" x 4.25"")
* The paper quality is actually better than I expected--smooth, bright white, ~25lb; it stands up quite well to repeated erasures without degrading; handles oil and gel ink relatively well (though liquid ink will feather and bleed); and can be torn away from the spine with relative ease

Overall, I'm content with my purchase. I hope this review was helpful to you, but if I missed something you'd like to know about this notepad, please leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer.",5
Nice!,5
We love this map! It hangs in our living room and we mark on it the places we have been. It is very large so make sure you have enough space on your wall for it. We currently do not have it in a frame because it would likely be expensive to find one big enough. We love it though!,5
"If you are looking for a durable wall map of the United States with an attention to detail, you can do much worse than this wall map.  I purchased this map to help my students learn about the United States as I taught English in Ukraine.  They enjoy the vibrant colors and the details that this map provides.  The map looks good hanging on the classroom wall and I can tell it will last for a very long time.  I recommend it for any teacher or even for a person who just wants a good all around map of the United States for their bedroom or dorm room.

I have had this map for a few months now and it has not ripped and shows no signs of damage.  I also took it on an airplane from the United States to Moscow and then to Kyiv, Ukraine and it has held up wonderfully.  Overall, this map met and exceeded my expectations.",5
Pretty great quality,5
Very good for its price,5
Huge map - excellent for a kid's room - its only weakness is the bizarre sizing of the states of Alaska and Hawaii that appear in the bottom left corner. I give it 5 stars because it's really a great map for your money.,5
Very clear and easy to read. It's HUGE too.,5
Awesome and cheap...:-),5
"This is, no joke, a HUGE map!  I purchased this and a world map and, together, they cover almost an entire wall in my home classroom.",5
"WOW!! Is this thing big!! Beautifully done and very legible. Excellent, striking addition to our homeschool classroom.",5
"Works great in our homeschool classroom, it really helps my son learn his states.",5
"Good quality, shipped fast.  I'm pleased",5
"It's perfect and exactly as described. I wish I had gotten one that was laminated though--I'm using it for my kids to show what states we have been to. I was thinking of getting it laminated once it got here (to save money, I thought) but it's too wide for any school supply laminators! Ooops! But I love it! My kids love it! It's huge and we like it!",5
This is a great tool for my classroom.  Got it laminated so it will last for years to come.  I only wish it came laminated.,5
"This map is vividly colored, is made of fairly good quality paper (though is still easy to tear), and is much larger than I anticipated when I impulsively bought it on here. I find it very useful and highly recommend owning this map, especially if you live in this country!
I have it hanging right by my bed, where I frequently see it - due to the the size and color, it catches everybody's attention who happens across it, as well. I find myself often referencing it while reading an article online, watching news, or planning my next adventure in the States.
It is a great means for connectedness - seeing where you are in respect to everyone else in this country (and snippets of Canada and Mexico) corrects your perspective on things. It has opened my eyes. :-)",5
great poster! Well made! Easy to read and locate things on the map. Good learning resource for any classroom or homeschool.,5
"I ordered these maps, I ordered two and I was overjoyed to find them of such great quality. When I say they are huge, they will nearly cover an entire wall. Clear, great weight to the paper and just what I wanted.",5
Rand McNally U.S.A Wall Map it was what i wanted a very nice map not to big not too small,5
"My kids love to look at a map.  This hangs on the wall in the playroom.  It's inexpensive enough that I am not concerned about damaging, so long as they aren't trying to be destructive.  My three kids play ""travel the country"" (a game they made up) all the time, using this map.  Not really sure what they're doing, but they're having fun and I here little tidbits about states and cities, rivers, mountains, etc.  so it's a win :)",5
"My product arrived crushed from Amazon, but the map is essentially intact save the unsightly creases every 1.5"".

The map is bright and colorful and major cities are marked as well as lower Canada (the only part of Canada most Americans visit!) The boyfriend and I are marking places we've been and it looks great on our bulletin board. We have a new home we're trying to spruce up and the map brightens the wall up and looks so interesting with the pins. We bought an 100 set of pins and we used them all up even before we finished marking every where've been. I can't wait to get my world map to hang alongside this map. :)",5
"I ordered this for my office because I have the same map that I purchased as a set (US, World, some other smaller map) in my office at home. The map is great but the set that I have at home is laminated.

This is a great value for the price though.",5
"I bought this map to post in our homeschool room for reference. I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. It came rolled in a tube, so there were no creases. The paper is thin, but because it's light, it stays on the wall quite well. (I use putty.) It's large enough that you can make out the individual countries in Europe. And it has quite a bit of detail as far as cities, rivers, and lakes. I like that the fonts and sizes of the type clearly show what are continents, what are countries, and what are cities. That's important for young learners.",5
"It's hung in one of my daughters' rooms. It's reasonably up to date, clear, easy to read, and inexpensive. What's not to like? Well, laminated would be better to avoid sticky fingers, but that would raise the price as well.",5
"We use this as a wall map for geography homework. It's terrific. It's got good color, and good detail. We put it up with 3M poster strips, which are removable from the wall. The poster hung up easily. It's been up for over a month with no problems. We have it at eye level where the kids pass it every day.",5
was a gift,5
It's cheap.,5
Does the map thing very well.,5
As advertized. Quality map.,5
We homeschool our kids. I stapled this to the wall and we use it daily.,5
"Good quality, was shipped late",5
"Not the best map projection, but hard to complain for such a large map at this low price. Hang one in your house now! Dream about going places, then go there.",5
"Good Political Map.  The world is changing, sometimes I can remember what they called some countries (Congo), than what their new names are.  Also, it never hurts to look at a world to better understand what is going on.  Best use of $5.00, I can think of.  If you have kids, put this somewhere where they can get at it.",5
"I purchased this for my bedroom wall and I'm in love. It is very large and bright, it looks great. Everyone that comes over and sees it comments on it. One of my friends even got one for herself after loving the way it looked on my wall. It is a nice educational tool but really I just like how it looks.",5
Bought this for a friend and she loves it. She likes to keep track of what is going on in the world.,5
nice map,5
Awesome and cheap...:-),5
I bought one of these for my daughters room and was so impressed that I ordered 2 more for my room and the living room. This poster is very large.,5
"We have this on our dining room table under a thick plastic sheet. It makes for great conversation about geography and history for our small children. The paper is thick, and it is quite colorful. This is a new map with countries that I've never heard of before! Who new that Canada is now its own country? (I'm kidding).

This is a great tabletop or wall map. We are very happy with it.",5
Great large map. Now I just need a frame for it!,5
"This is, no joke, a HUGE map!  I purchased this and a US map and, together, they cover almost an entire wall in my home classroom.",5
good,5
Great classroom map for the price.,5
"Great quality, perfect for my kids room. Was well protected during shipping",5
Love the size & the details! Perfect for map work!,5
"It's a map.  It's big.  It's folded.  Folds do not come out easily.  If this bothers you, get the more expensive rolled up version.  Happy with the purchase, and the price was right.",5
Just beautiful!! Very detailed and legible. We had it laminated for our homeschool classroom.,5
Love the size for our homeschool classroom,5
as described,5
"This is a nice, colorful world map.  Great value here on Amazon.  I wish it was laminated but for the price I'll just laminate it myself.  Great purchase.",5
This is great for my classroom.  I only wish it was laminated to protect it.  I will be getting it laminated so it will last for years.,5
This map is large and beautiful. It's just a shame that Russia seems to have changed it so soon after I bought it.,5
"Exactly what I wanted. Came on time , it's perfect!",5
"I use this map to keep track of all the places I have been with my wife.  We love to travel and it is fun to keep track of all the places.  We only mark the places we have actually walked around and felt like we ""experienced it"".",5
good deal!,5
"It's a map and it does its job very well. I bought this to hang on the wall and plan a road trip so it was nice to have a large map to draw out a game plan. The lamination on this map is enough to keep it protected if you plan to hang it on the wall or in a classroom, but it's not too thick where it's heavy and unwieldy.",5
Looks great on my wall.  Use my grease pencils on it all the time.,5
"looks great, good price",5
OK.,5
"Love it, I use it against cork to map places I want to travel to and where I've been :-)",5
It does a great job of hanging there on my wall.  Quite crisp and defined.,5
Nice,5
"I,love this...",5
"I always have a set of US and World maps in my homes. These are beautiful and clear.  Very thin laminate, not a problem at all. Great colors and detail.",5
Very nice map.,5
Fantastic,5
"<div id=""video-block-R3HUUQLZI1EFLS"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1DyFwdUcfS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DQVsvvCLS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;My package arrived in 2 days (Prime) in a long, 4""x4""x36"" box.  The map itself was rolled in a plastic sleeve and there was a modest amount of packing material in the box to keep the map from shifting around. My map was in perfect condition when I removed it from the shipping box.  Kudos to the shippers at Amazon.

The map has a glossy finish but it is not stiff.  I guess when people read it is laminated, they associate that with laminated ID cards which are hard plastic.  This is best described as paper with a waterproof coating on it. I was not concerned about the coating as we plan to frame this and put it on the wall in our spare bedroom and use pins to mark all the places we travel to.

This map is absolutely beautiful and looks awesome framed and mounted. It shows many cities and towns in every state, it also show rivers and relief.  It identifies the major mountain ranges, shows most (if not all) National Parks, National Recreation Areas, National Monuments, mountains with their elevation, and much more. I can't express enough at how great this map looks and it was only $10.xx!  We've traveled to most of the US and are embarking on a 22 state trip during the summer of 2014 and we found out a pack of 100 map pins is not nearly enough.

In summary, you will be very happy with this map.  And we will try to remember to come back here and post a picture or video of it once we get it up on the wall.  If not, it will be on our web site.

UPDATE:  I added a short video showing the map framed and mounted on the wall. We still have to add pins for 20 more states!",5
I bought this for my eight year old son.  He loves it.  Its perfect for marking out where we have been.,5
We are using this to show my son where His Daddy is when he travels for work. Also were all our relatives live around the country.,5
"Very large great for anyone wanting to learn states, capitals and major cities.  Needs large area to hang and may cost a bit to frame.",5
"I didn't realize it when I ordered, but this is a laminated wall map.  It is a plasticky material - not paper.  It is labeled ""wipe on wipe off"" which I presume means it would work with dry erase markers.  I haven't tried.  The colors are very vibrant and the map shows a lot of detail.  We have this next to a similar world map (though not laminated) in my daughter's playroom.  Between the two maps, she has a great time finding places around the world and in the US of A.",5
"I was stunned to see the prices of larger maps when I needed additional classroom maps.  I looked around and found these and took a chance, buying two. I could not be more pleased.  One hangs out in the corridor and we pin postcards to it as a part of a year-long project, the other is on a pull-down screen in my room. Can't beat the price.",5
"the Randy Mcnally USA map is a great map for the classroom, office, or just for your room. it has great detail on it like: popular town and cities are marked in bold, capitals are marked with a star, major intersections are shown, it has the different time zones at the top of the map, some of the provinces of canada are exposed at the very top, its got the oceans named out, a compass, and it comes laminated. i know i missed a few other features, but it is a great map to have of the USA.",5
"We're very pleased with the Rand McNally M-Series USA wall map (30"" x 52"").

Previous reviews indicate there may have been shipping issues that resulted in damaged maps.  I'm pleased to say this was NOT the case with my order (and more recent reviews also indicate Amazon has fixed the problem).  The map arrived securely rolled in original plastic wrapping inside a very strong-walled shipping tube.  PLEASE NOTE: I purchased directly from Amazon... so I can't speak of how any third-party seller is shipping.

Pros:  Great size... it's big enough to easily identify all states and cities.  The coloration is very well done; it's colorful without being either too dull or, to the other extreme, obnoxiously bright.  Lamination indicates you can write on / wipe off with with a dry-erase marker.

Cons:  The map (and lamination) is rather thin.  The lamination is not heavy-duty enough to prevent tears or rips.  We're protecting it further by hanging it on the wall inside a cheap poster frame.",5
"Very nice detail, color and quality.",5
great!,5
"I purchased this at full price for my mom for Christmas.  She actually requested this exact one.  She loves watching the news and is always wondering where certain countries are in relation to each other.  Now she can see for herself!

It is definitely a large map, perfect for a classroom.  My mom hung hers in our game room.  She tried to hand it with thumbtacks at first but because it had been rolled for so long, they kept pulling and popping out.  I think she finally decided on nails to get it to stay.

She loves the bright distinguishing colors and even though her eyesight is bad, with her glasses, she can still make out most of it and the tinier portions she just uses her handy dandy magnifying glass.

This is a great gift for teachers, history buffs and current event nuts alike.  I know my mom just loves it!",5
good deal!,5
GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"great,  it is really worth $15...  It is ideal for kid's room,  probably not the best for the office or classroom as the plastic / lamina is rather thin....  Maps is huge 50x32 and quite detailed,  all major cities....",5
I watch a lot of world news and was constantly looking up where certain countries were located and what countries bordered them.  So I ordered this map after reading several of the reviews.  It is large and takes up a big part of my wall but is quite attractive and is laminated so that it will stay fresh looking for years to come.  Each country is in a different color is quite distinct and easy to find.  This map suited my needs quite well and I'm very pleased with it.,5
OK.,5
We've had this nearly 5 years and it has held up really well and we've moved 4 times and we just roll it up and pin it back on the wall. It is laminated nicely and doesn't fall with pins. The font is a little small in places if you're trying to study it. We actually have the same sized one of the U.S. and have used them in our office.,5
"This is a large, beautiful up to date wall map that is laminated on both sides.  I had a big blank space on my wall and I love maps, especially when something happens in the world and I want to see where that place is.  So, this map is attractive, well made and accurate (it has South Sudan, the newest country).  It came packaged so there was no transportation damage whatsoever.  I can't find any fault with it.",5
"I always have a set of US and World maps in my homes. These are beautiful and clear.  Very thin laminate, not a problem at all. Great colors and detail.",5
"The World Wall Map Deluxe Laminated 50"" x 32"" M Series Map of the World is a large wall map.  I bought this map as a gift for my 13 year old nephew who will need it for middle school geography lessons  It arrived in great condition and packaging.  Great buy.",5
Came in a artsy tube in two days. I put it up in my garage with thumb tacks and it looks great. Nice size.,5
Its one of the inexpensive maps I have ever purchased. I bought for my kid. You might need to add crimea to Russia now :) It doesnt belong to Ukraine anymore.,5
Looks good on the wall with my US map made by the same company. A well made product. I'm very pleased.,5
"simply awesome. no issues. 5 stars. worth the money. very good quality of print, the size is awesome, and now we have an awesome wall to look at :)",5
"very large,I mark it every time I fly internationally and state wide, have it on my wall, its durable and cleanable",5
"Very thorough and distinctive map. Bought it for my grandkids to imaginary travel around the world. Looking at it almost every night before going to bed. They just point the place and I open the internet page about the country and we disappear into the pictures of nature, buildings, costumes, food and so on. 10 minutes every day - and kids learn a lot!",5
Very nice map. I put it in my office and it really enhances the appearance of that particular wall. I have just obtained some map pins to identify places I've been and it should be a good addition.,5
"bought this for a Christmas gift for my grandson along with another map, tacks, flags.  I know he will love it.  Received it quickly.  Thank you",5
"We've got this map pinned to the wall in the family room, and almost every day one of my young sons asks where a certain city or country is, and I can just point right to it.  The lamination really makes it durable.",5
"This map is really nice. My 6 and 7 year olds are learning about countries, oceans and continents and this is perfect. The fact that it is laminated is a bonus. It comes with 2 hangers, but I like all 4 corners attached to keep it flat.. It's current home is on our 6"" x 4"" porcelain chalkboard and is a hit.",5
you need a cheap map of the world? this is it. Bought it for a presentation. glued it to a foam board and pushed lots of pins into it. fit the bill.,5
"Good quality for the price. Super fast shipping and good packaging. I guess it was bigger than I imagined, but that's not a bad thing. Shows countries and cities and geography. I love to look at the world hanging there on my wall.
Thick material. Two brackets that I used nails to hold onto the wall. Kinda flimsy, but when on the wall it is fine.",5
"This is a lovely map.  Big, colorful, and a little bit sturdier then paper (it isn't a thick laminate...they would have to charge 5x's as much, if that were the case.  However, you can put stickerss on it, and they remove easily.  Also, washable markers if washed off gently).  Amazon shipped it in a big box, so there was no damage to the map.  We are VERY happy with it.",5
"bought for my grandson for Christmas.  I am sure he will love this along with the other maps, tacks, and flags.",5
The map was exactly what we were looking for in a world map.  We bought it as a Christmas gift for our 20 year old son who requested it for his dorm apartment.  He said that many times discussions came up with his room mates and friends about where a country is located in the world.  The only chuckle my wife and I had when it arrived was the box it was shipped in.  You could have put a small bicycle in it.  We thought a mailing tube would have been more efficient.,5
Love this,5
"Using this map for my travel map photo project. I am putting pictures of each state I have visited and hope to eventually have this map filled up. I ordered this map specifically because of the sizes of each state. I recently went to Hawaii, and noticed on many maps that you can BARELY see Hawaii, let alone to be able to see a picture of us visiting. I found this map had Hawaii pretty visible and decided to try it. I have to admit when I received the map, it was VERY BIG! Much bigger than I thought it would be. I contemplated returning this but realized if I got any smaller of a map the smaller states would be impossible to see. Texas is at least an 8x10 photo, while Connecticut is 1 inch by maybe 2 at the most. At least with that size I am able to put my picture from Connecticut on this map. Any smaller would have not allowed me to make my craft. This map is laminated and comes rolled up not folded. Great colors and able to see ALL states. Would recommend buying. Great for the price!",5
Great gift for grade schooler,5
Great map!  Shows a lot of detail.,5
Really nice size and more colorful than some other employee's maps. Came well packaged and at a good price.,5
A good map.  Nice size.  I attached it to a large cork board and I use it to track my various travels and use push pins to mark the interesting placed I have been.,5
"Pleased with this purchase!  Filled a large, blank wall in a new office.  Colorful and easy to read.",5
great,5
Great for the money $ 15 and it looks very nice and colorful .,5
"Was looking for a map for a project with second graders. This was affordable, already laminated, and a great size for what we paid.",5
"I have this map on the wall in my office and use it to plot where I have traveled on vacation.  When I see an area that's ""unmarked,"" it gets added to the bucket list.  Easy to clean, has lasted well (4+ years and lots of vacations!)",5
"We're very pleased with the Rand McNally M-Series USA wall map (30"" x 52"").

Previous reviews indicate there may have been shipping issues that resulted in damaged maps.

The map arrived securely rolled in original plastic wrapping inside a very strong-walled shipping tube.  PLEASE NOTE:  I purchased directly from Amazon... so I can't speak of how any third-party seller is shipping.

Pros: Great size... it's big enough to easily identify all states and cities, while small enough to fit inside a standard poster frame. The coloration is very well done; it's colorful without being either too dull or, to the other extreme, obnoxiously bright. Lamination indicates you can write on / wipe off with with a dry-erase marker.

Cons: The map (and lamination) is rather thin. The lamination is not heavy-duty enough to prevent tears or rips. We're protecting it further by hanging it on the wall inside a cheap poster frame.",5
"Bought this for my grandson for Christmas.  I bought this along with other maps, tacks, and flags.  Everything arrived by due date.",5
"This map is huge! It's great, it is a large size and all of the major cities are well marked. The muted colors help demarcate states while not being too showy.",5
I have very little useable wall space and bulletin board space. This number line fit perfectly into the space I had planned for it. Love that it is numbered to 100 and shows odd/even and each numbered is spelled out.,5
"This number line is PERFECT!  I love that the odd and even numbers are different colors, which helps students to see a pattern.  It also means that they can make the numbers closer together but the students will still be able to differentiate between the numbers.  The word-form on top of each one is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!  I made sure to laminate mine before posting it.  Anything that I put in my classroom quickly bends and gets wavy because of the condensation on the slick paint on the walls.  I wish they offered this in different colors or themes, but it's absolutely perfect functionally.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy one or to recommend this to someone.  I have other teachers ask me ALL THE TIME about where I got this one.",5
Works and Looks Great. Just what my students need to understand our number system,5
Great addition to the class room.,5
"My previous number line was way longer than my front wall. This one looks a bit compact, but it's still quite visible from the back of the room. Extra nice how evens are blue and odds are red.",5
Happy with my product.,5
Great calendar to put in my classroom. It has different months and cards for special days. It has 3 holes at the top to hang from hooks. It is very sturdy and has held up great! It's very nice quality and worth the price. This was a great investment for my classroom.,5
Nice product.  Love it in my classroom!,5
Perfect for my classroom ... so far happy with my choice,5
Product as described. Quick shipping!,5
The chart is great. I only wish they had a package that was more suitable for preschool. This would include jobs like calendar helper and lunch helper.,5
I am a former kindergarten and first grade teacher.  I currently have a preK-er at home and am teaching preK math in my apartment to my child and her friends twice a week.  This calendar is *perfect*- its exactly as described and my kids love it!  They are definately getting a lot out of its use.,5
Does exactly what it says it will do.,5
great,5
"THIS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I EVER BOUGHT FOR MY TINY LITTLE OFFICE SPACE IN MY BEDROOM. HOLDS AS MANY AS 20-25 8 1/2 X 11"" FILE FOLDERS DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTENTS PER FOLDER BUT IT TAKES UP NO SPACE AT ALL EXCEPT ON THE WALL, SO I DON'T KEEP BUMPING INTO IT WHERE IT STICKS OUT FROM THE WALL LIKE THE PLASTIC ONES WHICH BREAK WITH THE SLIGHEST BUMP OF MY CHAIR AND COST A WHOLE LOT MORE AND HOLD A WHOLE LOT LESS. i BOUGHT TWO OF THEM AND THEY WORK SO WELL TO ORGANIZE MY WORK FILES, THE ONES I REFER TO EVERY DAY. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE WITH SPACE ISSUES WHO WANTS THEIR WORK CLOSE BY BUT DOESN'T HAVE ROOM ON THEIR DESK OR ROOM FOR A FILE CABINET AND WHO DOESN'T MIND A LITTLE BRIGHT BLUE OR RED FILING SYSTEM! THEY WERE MEANT FOR USE IN CLASSROOMS BUT WORK REALLY WELL FOR A SMALL OFFICE SPACE. THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD DESIGN SOME FOR HOME OFFICES, NOT JUST CLASSROOMS, IN MORE CONSERVATIVE COLORS.",5
"I have this hung on my kitchen wall using command hooks. This has been a great way to keep clutter off our kitchen island. We have folders for build, school information, pets, neighborhood news, etc....Definitely recommend this product!",5
The folder organizer is great! I used it for my classroom to hang up books and it looks great! The organizer is very sturdy and holds things very strong!,5
"Great for organizing!!!  I started with two sets, and purchased 2 more for my husband's office.  Great hanging on the back of the den door.  Very handy, and no-one sees them.  And much better than securing them to the wall and leaving holes, etc.  Very sturdy!",5
"This file organizer is attractive, sturdy, and  it does not take up much space. I absolutely recommend it to anyone.",5
"I love this organizer. I got two and i have all the extension activities, anchor activities for students. Also, I have my ""graded"" papers, and ""to grade"" papers which makes everything easier to file and find.",5
I bought five charts to organize the work for independent practice between whole group and small group practice for Common Core State Standards Mathematics.  Files are available with copies and I can do a quick check of what needs replenishing or replacing.  I also purchased super strong velcro for the concrete walls.,5
"The quality is great.  This has been a great device for us to use for assignments for my sons (I homeschool them).  Just enough pockets to put one Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday folder for each boy.  I used 5 blue folders for one son and 5 green folders for the other.  Works perfectly!",5
"I hung this on my computer desk cabinet door to organize, and keep handy, files with bills due, receipts, pet records, papers to file, paper to shred, ect.  It works perfectly for my use. It's made very well and I think it will hold up very well. My desk is now uncluttered and this takes up minimal space. And, since my bi-fold cabinet door is always open, it's out of sight.  I hung it with push pins . . so far, so good.
GREAT organizational tool for a desk that happens to be in the dining room!",5
"I run a business out of my home and this makes it so easy to stay organized in the various stages of orders as they come in.

I loved it so much I bought more for my kids' rooms- I added their names to the top and now they can keep all their magazines, papers, drawings etc up off the floor. They are sturdy and a really great organizing tool!",5
"This is awesome.  Does not take up much space.  Can be hung with just some thumb tacks!  Very lightweight.  I use it to file the disposable grocery ads each week, and to keep a folder of grocery coupons I may or may not use from time to time.  Or, to hold on to magazines until I throw them out.  Or, perhaps to hold random pages of magazines I've ripped out, to remind me of the next hairstyles I want to try out on my husband.  :)  Election mailers and voter information stuff that I collect until I really delve into them...Or ongoing coupons to Kohls or Costco...you get the idea.  The bottom files are for the kids to put some of their school documents in, so they always have a spot to put stuff they don't want to lose, like upcoming field trip permission slips or homework they are working on, or whatnot.  It has never fallen down off our wall, in over a year, despite the load we have used it for!  Anyway, it's not really attractive at all, but super functional.  Love it.",5
We are pleased with our  purchase. It fulfilled our home organizing needs! The product seems quite durable and well made.,5
I use this in my sixth grade classroom. It's durable and colorful. Students frequently access items from the folders and the chart has yet to show wear. I'll probably order another one for one of my other classes.,5
This is great - we have folders in each pouch for sorting mail in the office. Well made and such a simple solution!,5
"This wall chart has helped me become far more organized.  Instead of cluttering my desk with a bunch of file folders or sticking important file folders into a file cabinet where they are never viewed again, I can now hang them right on the wall in a convenient location.",5
"This is a great set! However, I highly recommend laminating it and attatching Velcro to the pieces! My preschoolers love this weather panda!",5
Item is listed as described. Would recommend to others. Works well and would buy again. Have no complaints about it.,5
Just want I need in my classroom,5
My favorite agenda.,5
Keeping this teacher organized!,5
"This is a pocket chart with the colorful cards. I like that it has a place for the digital and the analog time. includes pre-made cards, but also some with no words for you to write your own which is nice since I have a few things there aren't cards for. Use it every day. Definitely the easiest schedule I've had. Glad I bought this. definitely recommend.",5
Use it daily,5
I think all teachers need these at some point.  They work  well for just about everything.,5
Good product,5
Love this for my class schedule.,5
I love the blank schedule cards that allowed me to write my own lessons on them!,5
"A very useful pocket chart set for any classroom. If the chart is about 10 cm wider, it will be more convenient.",5
"I really like that the schedule cards allow me to write in the times to correspond with the activities. This really helps my kiddos figure out the schedule as it corresponds to the classroom clock. These do need to be laminated if you want to reuse them, and I did need to order an additional package of schedule cards to accommodate all of the weekly activities we have scheduled. Great product.",5
Love this!!!! The kids absolutely love it to!!! Great for use in the classroom or even at home!!! Would definitely recommend this item!!! High quality and worth the cost!!! Great cost for the quality to!!!,5
This is an excellent teaching resource. The numbers are large enough to see from a distance and the colors are bright enough to hold student interest. The storage pocket is an added plus!!,5
"Perfect, but all of the straws don't fit in the pocket at once.",5
Was exactly what I wanted!,5
Perfect for lower grades.,5
Perfect for my Morning Meetings. I do put the straws in a separate container as they did not stay well in the pouch.,5
Awesome tool to teach. Just keep the straws away from the reach of children that like to touch things when you are not looking.,5
Is exactly what I expected and fits description.,5
Good quality and made for years of use.,5
Great way to do a count for school,5
Works great for counting the days of school.,5
great for my kindergarten class,5
My students use it every day during morning math routines. it's great!!,5
Perfect for my classroom. Simple and easy to use.,5
"I had a different place value chart for many years, but it was flimsy.  I am happy I purchased this chart as it is a great resource and sturdy.",5
"I used this when I taught kindergarten. This was very simple and durable, and students really liked counting how many days of school we had left.",5
"I like the idea that the students are exposed to the place value concept every single day of the school year, since many students struggle with the concept. It is a nice visual way to show place value.  The pocket doesn't hold all the straws, but it holds enough for a month..",5
"I laminated my numbers and words immediately with my little Scotch Laminator. Then I cut the numbers and words out with my little Martha Stewart paper cutter (from scrap booking) to make nice straight lines. The straws look just like the straws you stir coffee with- maybe slightly bigger, but if you loose straws then just buy regular or coffee straws. The pouch is smaller but holds your extra straws and numbers. The dimensions make it just right for a smaller space on the wall. Has no problem hanging with smaller thumb tacks. I might make a second set of words and numbers so people can see from across the room easier- but the size it comes with is fine too.",5
"This is exactly what I was looking for! Will be a great addition to my morning calendar for my kindergarten class! Product is well made, though numbers cards seem a little flimsy",5
This is a sturdy product that helps children master the abstract concept of regrouping. A great addition to any classroom.,5
Perfect!!! arrived fast and as described! love it! Thank you!,5
Just what we were looking for,5
great for the classroom,5
"Nice and large, great addition to my classroom.",5
Perfect for my Math Sentence Stems!,5
Perfect!,5
Purchased for school.  Didn't hear any complaints (and believe me I would) so assume they are happy.,5
It does the job!,5
"Fabulous! Very big and not very heavy, so it is easy to hang. The metal grommets at the top make it versatile for hanging anywhere.

It is easy to find premade strips to use. There are so many ways to use a pocket chart.

This was a great investment for our homeschool classroom!

For our first project, we built sentences. It soon led to the kids creating a whole bunch of their own cards (using index cards, cut in 1/2). The creativity that this tool inspired, made it well-worth the (very reasonable) cost.",5
"Love it, use it daily with word blending and more. don't have to use sentence cards yet as the tabs are big enough to hold regular paper cutouts. The bar on the bottom is great for curl prevention. Would not hesitate to buy again.",5
my boys like to have this every month they change the dates and seasons month and put bdays up special dates .,5
"This is a large pocket chart.  It's perfect for whatever you'd like to use it for.  I use it with sentence strips for reading.  It has a sewn in rod at the bottom (as do all Scholastic pocket charts).  So, it lays flat.  The reinforced grommets are great, however, you will not be able to hang this on a wall using 3M clear hooks.  So, I used bread ties to attach it to the 3M hooks I ordered to use with this.  Works just fine.  I do feel like I paid too much for this product.  It's just a thin nylon sheet with plastic pockets on it.  But, it works great for the purpose I'm using it for.",5
It is good quality and working well for me.  I only wish pocket charts were universal in where they put their holes for hanging.,5
"I bought these for our calendar.  We have a block schedule at the school I work for.  I use the green colored for one day, yellow for another, and red for days when we have no school.  Please note that you only get the numbers.  You do not get the chart itself, days of the week or months.",5
The best thing is the size of the numbers.,5
Very colorful.  Good replacement for original squares.,5
Nice product.  Love it in my classroom!,5
These were just what I needed. They matched perfectly with the blue dates I had from another set.,5
I love this chart. It works well in my classroom and the students interact with it. Thank you for this chart.,5
Great.,5
"I have had many changes in my schedule this year and I have to say that these cards have held up through 3 changes of times and still look good. I used a permanent market and to erase it, I used rubbing alcohol to take it off. If I did not have so many changes, they would last me years.",5
Love this for our home classroom!!,5
"I bought these in addition to the schedule pocket chart, and I really like them. You will need to laminate tham if you want to reuse them though.",5
Exactly what I expected! It works perfect for holding the forms I need for my after school program.,5
"Exactly what I wanted to have a folder for every day of the week plus a calender slot, planning slot, and one extra.",5
Pretty good for office papers organizing,5
perfect for organizing.,5
Exactly what I needed.,5
"I love that I finally found a pocket chart that will match my classroom. I never liked the obnoxious blue, red, or green options. This is a sturdy, good quality pocket chart.",5
"Perfect size for homeschool. This chart doesn't take up too much space, but still is plenty big enough to hang on a wall and work with. I also loved that it came in black.",5
This has completed the look of my classroom,5
Perfect for my classroom,5
An excellent pocket chart at a very reasonable price,5
This is a great addition to my 2nd grade classroom. I also like the price of it.,5
GREAT,5
Didn't realize this was the large chart until it arrived. Great price.,5
recommended to us by my kid's teacher. really good buy,5
One of the best investments I have made when my child was 5,5
"I bought this for my 8 year old.  This is a pretty nice dictionary for kids.  It is somewhat heavy though, so your kid needs to be of a certain age or strength to carry this book comfortably.  The weight comes from the quality of the paper and the book.",5
We are using this for school. Each of my kids have one. Its is such a basic planner and the same size as text books and spirals. It is lightweight yet sturdy. Everyday there is no question what needs to get done!,5
"LOVE these planners. They are very reasonably priced, hold up the entire school year and have a nice layout inside",5
This... is style.,5
Great key chain. Strong and easy to use.,5
"Well made hook key chain. This product will last a good while, it is also good looking. Well done.",5
Very nicely presented in its packaging and very functional for what my husband needed.,5
My husband and I love this key chain. We love the design!,5
Great product! Made of a good material. I use it to clip my keys too and it has not broken. It is very sturdy and does not feel cheap at all. I have had key chains that broke quickly in my pocket. Great material and cool packaging.,5
"As expected...delivery was on time, product has worked well.",5
works great,5
Sturdy and high quality product.  Quick delivery.,5
"Strong, sturdy key chain that works perfectly for my husband's keys.  It's durable, attractive & practical.",5
"I love them.  Beautifully cut, nice little package.  I like the idea of the vintage look and not all the of advertising shtick that goes on with today's Valentine Cards. Will think of how much I love them as I send them off to my grand kids. More than twice the price as the original sticker was attached, I will remember it every time I take one out of the box.  Thank you!",5
Loved these cards. Sent Valentine messages to friends in them.,5

"GIVING VALENTINE'S DAY CARDS IS NOT JUST FOR KIDS ANYMORE!!!

These cards are so lovely and elegant!!  I was astonished at how beautiful they are when I received them - worth every single penny - and then some.  The designs are a classy reminder of days gone by while the sturdiness and gloss of the card are very 21st Century!  I'm just as excited to send Valentines out this year as I was when in school.  As if the cards weren't enough to feel you're getting more than you paid for, the envelopes are also lined with a pattern that corresponds to all of the cards.  I ordered two boxes but as delighted as I am with these, I'm going to order more and hoard them for next year, too!  I also ordered the Old-Time Valentine stickers; however, they didn't arrive.  Amazon was quick to refund me for undelivered items but when I place my second order, I'll request the stickers again.  I think they'll make a lovely compliment to the cards.",5
Pretty cards on nice stock.,5
"I adore vintage cards! These are perfect, with crisp colors and a variety of designs. I could only wish that there were more ""non-romantic"" cards suitable for everyone, but they are just beautiful and I found as many as I needed to send to relatives and friends--and my husband will get a bounty of cards now and in the future!",5
"It was so fun to send these to people unexpectedly. Everyone loved getting it, too. I had compliment after compliment.",5
These were fun to make with my daughter. I would buy them again. :),5
"These greeting free Valentine cards are lovely.  They are very old-fashioned in appearance - Victorian, and are very pretty and ""old-fashioned"".  I sent many with little notes to my friends all over the USA at Valentines Day, and everyone (of course my age bracket) loved the cards!  This was a happy purchase.",5
"Good quality notebook, very pleased.",5
"Really lovely notebook.  Good paper, lovely layout.  Not sure on the durability, as I haven't carried it much, yet - nor on the accuracy of the sizing - merely haven't checked it.

I have no idea why people are downgrading it for the religious aspect.  The listing is quite clear about it - seems as if they merely are seeking out a way to be offended.  I cannot see any reason why this wouldn't be suited to carry in a workplace. There's a brief message inside the front cover - which would hardly ever be seen, and shouldn't offend anyone if they did see it.  (Its not as if folks don't wear crucifixes and saints medals on a regular basis.)",5
excellent,5
"I'm a postcard collector/swapper who regularly sends and receives cards from all corners of the world.  This collection of 100 Maverick Postcards is truly a great bargain! It has a great mix of what I consider art cards and cards with text only. I confess that I don't really ""get"" all of them, but they're still fun to read and send :)  Highly recommended!",5
"hate my biochem professor..
beside of that..
Ive never used this one..since that class..",5
I click click away in class,5
works great,5
Ok,5
I don't really have any comments for this product. It works fine! Use it all the time here in college.,5
"I was a little perturbed that the professor made us buy this as a supplement to a book that costs $170, but it's a fun toy.  I got it for $30 here on Amazon.  The campus book store sells it as high as $45.  The discount made the purchase bearable.

From a usefulness standpoint, it shows reports to the professor (how students' answered, what needs to be reviewed, etc.), and it's a great way to take attendance.  Very easy to use.",5
"I only got this because my physics class required it, as for the product itself, i guess it would be useful for professors looking to do quizzes. It's fast easy, and saves paper.",5
"Very easy set up, extremely simple to use, and the battery life is unbelievable. I would definitely recommend this to fellow students!",5
Beautiful! Just what I wanted.,5
These cards were a gift to a friend for her birthhday. She loved them. I would buy more with different images.,5
"I am an avid note writer - the old school kind - and am always on the lookout for note cards that appeal to me.  My brother and his family live in Japan, so these immediately hooked my attention.  They are even prettier in real life than the pictures are here.  And, the paper is strong card stock, so they seem like they are really good quality.",5
"Beautiful set of cards, envelopes and case",5
So pretty!  I am giving this as a bridal shower gift.  Love the recipe cards that come with it.,5
"Even those of us with huge cookbook collections acquire random recipes. There's just so long you can keep them stuffed in a box -- at least, if you ever hope to find them again. For several years I have used an ordinary looseleaf notebook from the office supply store, along with the single clear plastic document sheets, and it has indeed kept me a bit more organized. Thus I can find the 20-year-old chili recipe from my pal Bill (printed on a dot matrix printer), the photocopy of the paella recipe from the back of the box the paella pan came in, and a fig dessert recipe that apparently came off a package of figs years ago.

But it's not especially pretty. So when Amazon Vine offered me this recipe organizer from the Victoria & Albert museum -- adorned with William Morris designs! -- how could I say No? I am really happy with it.

The recipe organizer is rather what you would expect: a three-ring binder with pre-made category tabs (fruits & vegetables; breads & pasta; etc.) It also has several pre-printed sheets for scribbling down recipes by hand, including room on the right for ingredients, and a lined area on the left for instructions. Most of my standalone recipes are already printed, so I'm not sure I'll use many of them, but I do like 'em. (A small note says that free downloadable PDFs refills are available online.) What I DO expect to refer to often is the charts on the inside cover, such as roasting temperatures for meat and an oven Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion chart. (I have a few of these, but can never remember where they are.)

The construction is good, the organization is reasonable, and the whole thing's quite attractive. It'd make a dandy housewarming gift for someone in a new home, even if you can't justify its purchase for yourself.",5
"With the internet and unlimited amount Recipe sites one would think Recipes Books are obsolete But they're not I have a KitchenAid cookbook that I love to use. I print out internet recipes I like to prepare. And I still clip recipes out of magazines  or make copies of them.  At my job  Im on the computer 8 hours a day so at the end of the day I don't want to use a computer. The William Morris Organizer is the answer to keeping all my favorites recipes together.

I was posting my 'most-used' recipes on my fridge Until  the William Morris Organizer arrived.  I love the Teal-like color. It goes with some picture frames I recently bought. I love the size of it. There are section dividers and spare pages to write your own recipes. Its a great throw back to personal recipe book.",5
"Glorious designs from famed Victorian-era textile designer William Morris are the highlight of this beautiful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/V-A-William-Morris-Recipe-Binder/dp/0735332622/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">V&A William Morris Recipe Binder</a>&nbsp;from the Victoria & Albert Museum.  The binder features eight sections (Fruits & Vegetables, Breads & Pasta, Eggs & Dairy, Soups & Salads, Meats & Poultry, Fish & Seafood, Desserts, Beverages), each highlighted by a sturdy pocket divider featuring a different William Morris design.

Recipe pages are unique and very well designed.  One side of each page is designed with a longer recipe in mind, while the reverse has space for two shorter recipes.  The left hand side of each recipe space has room for a Title, the name of the contributor and directions/notes, while a smaller right hand column highlights preparation time, number of servings and ingredient list.  You'll find 5 recipe pages per section, allowing for a total of 15 recipes per section. Pages are movable.  Beautifully printed on quality paper.

Grandma's $0.02 - This beautiful binder reminds me of an old Southern bridal shower custom well worth continuing.  Each friend of the bride contributes a special recipe to the bride to be so that she can begin married life with a good selection of tried-and-true dishes.  What a gift to treasure for a lifetime!

Very highly recommended",5
"I love these recipe organizers, and have made one for each of my children for family favorite recipes.  All the recipes that we save from friends & family and media are stored in one place....no more searching & searching.  I like the pockets in each section that I store recipe cards and such.  The 3 ring binder makes it easy to add pages as needed, I  use plastic page inserts so I can wipe away any cooking mess.

This binder is as beautiful as it is practical....highly recommend!",5
"This beautifully designed recipe organizer is impressive enough to give as a gift.  The sturdy construction will last years with proper care and could be handed down to the next generation, filled with all those tried and true family favorites. The exterior cover is embellished with a color woodblock print of William Morris.
 Inside the cover you will find several handy measuring and conversion charts. Three ring binder holds eight gorgeous tabbed pockets which are colorful and easy to read. The pages lay completely flat or can be held in a cookbook holder. Never lose another favorite recipe again! Each distinctive, woodblock printed pocket is roomy enough to hold 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper, recipe cards, magazine clipped or downloaded recipes. Tabs are labeled by category such as Fruits and Vegetables, Soups and Salads etc. Theyre different colors and easy to read.
Should you need more room to write recipes, they provide a site address making it possible to print off more. This is a great idea for the new bride, a foodie or gourmet chef. It makes an attractive addition to any cook's book collection. I recommend this to anyone who collects recipes.",5
"I will openly admit I bought this to store my Project Life cards. Project Life is a photo album/scrapbooking system with pocketed photo sleeves and the majority of the supplies are 3x4 cards and 4x6 cards to fit in those sleeves alongside the photos. It's really hard to store the cards flat, so I thought I would give a box designed for recipe cards a try. It's perfect! The 3x4 cards fit two across, and the 4x6 cards fit just as recipe cards would. You can flip through the cards easily, and organize certain sets and themes. You can also store photos in these boxes.

Besides being good for storage purposes, this is a beautiful box. It is basically laminated cardboard, but it's very durable and sturdy and the design is vivid and beautiful in real life. It looks awesome on my desk- it's not that deep (not as deep as the other recipe box I purchased to store the Project Life materials) so it doesn't take up a lot of space. So if you are looking to store a ton of recipes, I might look at other boxes. But the design sort of trumps the fact it's a bit shallow- even my husband mentioned how nice it was (!!)

Perfect for recipes, photos, Project Life, or anything that requires a 4x6 box. Highly recommended.",5
"This ""scrapbook-like"" loose leaf binder has everything one would want in making and keeping their favorite recipes that can be passed down over the years. The sturdy dividers have reproductions of prints by William Morris, a late-19th Century artist and designer ([...]). That was one thing that made this book ""special"" for me! There are adequate letter size sheets for your recipes and if you need more, a free pdf can be downloaded so that they can easily be printed. Each divider has a pocket to hold recipes in progress or other items. A very useful thing! Inside the covers are measuring equivalents and such that serves as a handy reference. This is a beautiful book just waiting for your favorite recipes! After you purchase a copy for yourself, I bet you'll want copies to use as gifts!",5
"This is such a lovely binder for collecting recipes. With all of the online recipe sites it's nice to have an old-fashioned standby for collecting. This binder is filled with inserts that divide into different sections (fruits & vegetables, breads & pasta, etc) There are blank pages in every section for you to write your own recipes on, and each divider has a pocket where you can slide pages or cards. The inside of the binder has general cooking information with conversion charts. This would make a lovely bridal shower gift alongside some pantry staples. Also a good way to collect family recipes. Very nice.",5
"Here's details on what's inside this attractive binder. Eight tabs for Fruits/Vegetables; Breads/Pasta; Eggs/Dairy; Soup/Salad; Meats/Poultry; Fish/Seafood; Desserts, and Beverages subdivide the contents. 8.5 x 11 inch paper, with double-sides printed, allows 120 recipes. (A PDF site enables one to print out more than this if needed).

Each page is scored. Most of the left-hand side is left blank for the headings of the recipe's title, who or where's it from, and the bulk for the steps needed. On the right-hand side, narrower spaces for preparation time, settings, and ingredients can be written in.

Finally, the binder with elegant William Morris wallpaper as its design motif graces the outside as well as the eight internal headings. It has four conversion charts, too. The combination of presentation and practicality should make this a welcome addition to any cook's kitchen shelf.",5
"For 15 years I have owned a 3x5 wooden recipe box with the type of lid that lifts up in such a way that it leaves a nice prop for you to stand the card on. I HATED IT! It was too small, cramped, and the desiqn of the lid made it impossible to see the cards in the back. On an impulse buy I grabbed this one. I love it! Its roomy, the cards(4x6) are large enough for ALL the info and since the lid opens like a normal lid would, I can easily flip to even the recipes in the back! I had to change some of the tab labels to suit my preferences but who cares. And although I've always stored my recipe box in the cupboard- after I received this one and saw how pretty it was, I felt compelled to find a place for it right out on the counter. It has a slight gloss to it so you can wipe messes off but I assume it will stain or get water damage fairly easily if you're not careful. But for now, while its pretty, it stays on the counter.",5
I gifted this adorable memo pad to a coworker and she loved it!,5
Exactly as advertised/depicted!,5
This was a Christmas list for a fellow Dachshund lover and she and I.  We love it.,5
They are as pictured and very cute.,5
This was a gift!  She likes the idea of having paper handy right by her phone!,5
"Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. The variety of sizes is wonderful as is the ""book"" to keep remaining ones together.",5
Love 'em,5
"I bought this set of labels - as well as the ""Forest Friends"" labels for my great nieces.  They are both very cute and will be enjoyed by the girls.  These are small but I think they will appeal to young children.",5
"I bought these to label my baby's books with both his name and the name of the giver. I like that these have enough room to put this info, and come in different designs as well as different sizes so that even small books get a label.  I think $5.50 is a good price for these, and am buying my second set, since he gets a lot of books!",5
"Very good looking, and perfect for inscribing in books.  I got these to cover a stamp that was in a book and they worked well.  Good range of sizes.",5
"The PEANUTS 2011 DAY-TO-DAY CALENDAR features a Peanuts comic strip for each day of the week of the year, except Saturdays and Sundays are featured on one page. This is disappointing for those who have been buying the Peanuts day-to-day calendars for years because it means no more full-page Sunday comics. I have either purchased or received as gifts several different 2011 day-to-day calendars and all of them have this format: Saturdays and Sundays are combined into one day. It's not something that just LLC Andrews McMeel Publishing has done but is something that is occurring throughout the industry. Of the four 2011 day-to-day calendars I have, published by three different publishers, they all have Saturday & Sundays combined into one day. Anyway, besides the Peanuts comic strip, the PEANUTS 2011 DAY-TO-DAY CALENDAR also features a little piece of trivia, riddle, or joke on the back of each page.  There's also a small illustration of either Linus, Sally, Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, or Peppermint Patty in the bottom-left-hand corner of the calendar. Even with the comic strip, illustration, and the date there's more than enough space to right appointments, reminders, or notes.",5
"I have bought this calendar every year for my wife, her sister and this year a niece for the first time. It is wonderful to wake up every day and start it with either a laugh or a contemplation. This calendar is the best!",5

"I found this to be an excellent resource for myself. Living with ADD is joked about, but those who have the brain activity, might laugh along with you on occasion, but, more often than not, not so funny.  This helps the ADD brain really focus on a task, and utilizes (in my opinion)the downside (short attention-span) as a positive... Repurchased this a third time.... (I think it would make a great IPAD app, so that one could avoid needing a new one every 90 days, but, until then, this works.)
*Lists are fabulous if you 1. can find where you left it, 2. use it, 3. see one, see two.... This book actually is very focusing, I would 100% recommend it for anyone who needs to organize their time, focus on the goals, and make something happen....",5
"I was saddened to hear of the death of this wonderful artist, Linda Nelson Stocks. Ms Stocks passed away a little over a year ago at the age of 72, and the final page of the 2013 calendar pays tribute to her. I am sure that her estate will keep on producing more calendars and planners, such as this lovely 2013 edition. As usual, each month has an appropriate country or village scene depicting activities from the 19th century. The village scene on the front of the calender is for the month of December, and shows Ms Stocks usual attention to detail. People are shopping, riding in sleighs down snowy streets and up hill sides, the homes and stores are inviting, and a lovely Christmas tree sits in the village square. It is the idealized rural village that continues to have a grasp on the imagination of so many of us, especially when you from time to time find yourself longing for a slower pace of life, even on just a temporary basis. The calendar can bring that to you! I have purchased Ms Nelson's calendars for years, and am never disappointed. I always look forward to her illustration for the month of October, as I believe she must have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of Halloween celebrations, as her picture for that month is always amusing. R.I.P, Linda Nelson Stocks.",5
Love the calendar- great quality and great large size. A classic that I'm happy they are still producing. I would highly recommend this,5
This wall calendar matches my pocket calendar--great for coordinating dates. The large date boxes make adding important appt. info very easy.,5
I have a country board that my calendars go on and this one fit perfectly. The pictures are beautiful and the quality is fantastic. I would definitely order from this vender again.,5
"Bought as a present for my mother.  I think she will like it, as it is reminiscent of calendars my dad used to bring home every year.",5
I order this calendar every year!  It is beautiful and the prints in it are frame worthy!  I have several of the prints from older calendars framed and hanging in my home!  I can not wait until the new one come out every year so that I can enjoy it all year long and change out my framed prints to the new one in the next years calendar!  You won't be disappointed if you buy this calendar!  Makes a great gift too!,5
I buy one of these calendars every year. I love Lang Folk Art.,5
"Hi, Beautiful! I love this drawings. They are folk art and inviting scenes of life. I have gotten this for a few years. I am saving the pictures...great art. Great calendar also.....moon phases and holidays..easy to write in squares. Well made/thick paper and sturdy opening to hang it up. I appreciate every picture...very nice/beautiful/exciting to have on my wall. Happiness....",5
I have about 20 years worth of Lang calendars packed away.  They really are well done pieces of art.  We enjoy them.,5
Love it,5
I love this calendar and have also purchased it in previous years.  The illustrations are so beautiful and timely to the month displayed.  Excellent quality.,5
"I order this calendar every year!  It is beautiful and the prints in it are frame worthy!  I have several of the prints from older calendars framed and hanging in my home!

You won't be disappointed if you buy this calendar!  Makes a great gift too!
The blocks are big enough to write all of your important dates in!  I have gotten so many compliments on this calendar!",5
"Absolutely beautiful artwork. I've bought these calendars for years, and they certainly make watching the years go by more enjoyable.",5
"It was in the middle of last year, that I spotted this perfect planner on sale. I was not happy with the one I had. So I threw that one away and started using the new one.  It had everything I needed in a planner.  So  this year, I looked for and found another one like it.  There's a place for notes and addresses; birthdays, anniversaries. A place in the back to stick bills or whatever. A place to write a quick appt and a place for notes on the sides.  Or if you're like me, I like to have a bigger place to write more .  This has both.  And the beautiful painted pictures throughout the book  brighten up my desk.  Well, worth the price .  I highly recommend this planner.",5
"I buy these every year and love them to set on our computer desk. I love that this years is white and not ivory pages, the white out strips looked awful on the ivory pages and I change my calender a lot so the new one? White out does not show on at all. I'm very happy with it and the art work is just beautiful this year!!",5
"My favorite engagement planner.  The art work is beautiful!  Nice spaces for writing notes, appts., etc.  MB is a talented artist.  I try and get one of these every year!",5
This item gets better each year.,5
Terrific daily journal.  Beautiful imagery.  A real keepsake for daily appointments as well as archiving year to year appointments or specific activities.,5
"This is a beauty of a calendar,, I enjoy getting this brand of calendars each year, the print is darker on this one and can see that so much better...enjoy these various birds.",5
"Get one every year , very nice .",5
Beautiful  calendar and graphics  Well constructed,5
"Each year I choose a different themed Lang calendar.

They are the best calendars ever because:
Sturdy paper
Eyelet for secure hanging
Linen like texture...good space and easy to record all
Beautiful illustrations each and every time

I keep all my calendars and they are a great reference point for memories and events that you may wish to consult.",5
My favorite of the Lang Calendars.  Fast shipping too.,5
Lang has always produced some of the most beautiful calendars!  The artwork is gorgeous and it is made very well.  I purchased two of the Lang Perfect Timing Songbirds for gifts this year and both recipients loved them!,5
Wonderful,5
Love it,5
This is a beautiful calendar of bird artistry produced by the incomparable Lang company with their beautiful heavyweight textured paper. I bought it as a gift for a birdwatcher.  She will love it!,5
Purchased this lovely calendar for my husband. He was very pleased.  The art work is gorgeous and the quality of the calendar is superb.  We have been buying these calenders for about 27 years.  Never been disappointed.  They make wonderful gifts for people with a discerning eye for beauty and a love of nature. Very practical too.,5
"If you enjoy watching birds in your garden, you will love this Songbird Calendar. The watercolor prints are beautiful with rich, vibrant colors. Each print is reflective of the month for which it is used; you will see fall foliage in October with the wren. If you can't identify a bird, there is a listing for each month at the back of the calendar along with a bio of the artist. There are many Lang Calendars to choose from, but I'm so glad I chose this one !",5
"WoW!  Another beautiful bird calendar for me.  When I found these calendars that are still a good size for writing on, I was sold.  Beautiful pictures, this will be a nice year to look at and mark important dates.",5
I buy these every year for my Daughters as Christmas gifts. Love the Lang calendar collections..,5
Looks great in my kitchen!!  Beautiful pictures of grapes and wine.,5
I have a wood frame to hold this style of calendar.  The wine theme aligns well with our life because we are wine enthusiasts.  The drawings are pretty and pleasant.,5
Looks great hanging in my kitchen that has an Italian theme.,5
these calendars are absolutely GORGEOUS I had one last year and then got one for this year. prints are on top quality card stock and frameable,5
"Received this pocket calendar several years ago.  Not only is it a great calendar for jotting down dates, it has pockets so that you can store notes, etc.",5
I buy this pocket calendar each year.  I love the quality and the convenience.,5
Love this calendar. The boxes are big enough to write notes and the pocket for each month is so helpful- this way you don't have to clutter up the fridge with notes. I like the primitive pics and buy a new one every year.,5
I use this calendar every year to help me pay my bills on time. I love the pockets!,5
Excellent calendars!,5
Great product.  I love the pockets.  I have been using this type of calendar for several years now.,5
Great product,5
Great deal on sandpaper letters!,5
I tried to make DIY sandpaper letters... don't waste your time -> buy these.,5
"These are very nice tactile letter cards for the price.  They do the job quite nicely, but I don't see them lasting longer than two school years.  Over all, though, I would highly recommend.  We haven't had any trouble with any of the grit (for lack of a better word) coming off of the cards, and they have really helped with encouraging letter recolonization and handwriting skills.",5
"Arrived promptly, no negative feedback from teacher at this time.",5
good product...,5
Excellent!,5
"I am using these passages for 5th and 6th grade students, and they are enjoying the material.  I like to find varied short pieces to expose them to since they often stick with just one Genre of their ""free choice"" reading material.  This book has a nice amount of variety in it and the questions are good at guiding the students back through the writing to find the information.  Clearly presented with easy-to-read font, this has been a great addition to my classroom.",5
Good work book!,5
great,5
Awesome product.,5
Good comprehension book.,5
This is a phenomenal source for helping middle schoolers pick out the important parts of non-fiction.,5
"My rising 8th grader is doing summer review work. She completed the book but she is reading the stories in the book again because she loves the stories. She likes them because they are quirky facts that are interesting. For example: why are prairie dogs called prairie dogs? The answer is in the story.

Also, the answers are in the back of the book so if your child does not cheat, this book could be a self teaching too that happens to be entertaining. Level wise, my daughter tells me it is geared towards advanced 6th and 7th grade levels. So as a rising 8th grader, this is a good review material.",5
"My son needs some practice and reinforcement on what he is learning in school - this workbook gives him that.
The answer key is necessary - it's been a long time since I was in 7th grade!
It also gives me enough information to help him when he makes mistakes.",5
"great selection
Makes a wonderful gift for your child's teachers that they will use and appreciate all year long and more!",5
These seasonal holiday stickers are a must for any collector or card sender. Recommended for their timelessness and approachability. Very homey type images and they peel off easily from their backing as well. Will return to this seller happily and recommend these to everyone.,5
great ideas and suggestions for all ages,5
Awesome,5
"Lots and lots of great ideas for homeschooling. Some of your own ideas or ones you practice may be in here but there are many ideas on how to be more creative, more interesting and she uses a lot of household items for teaching aids. Are you new to homeschooling? You need this book.",5
"This book was one of the first books I read when we had pull our son out of kindergarten after 1 month. I was reading everything I could get my hands on and I kept coming back to this book. Now, after successfully homeschooling two children for two years, I'll be purchasing it because it is that good. Library only has one copy and it's out all the time..lol",5
My daughter is a Game of Thrones fan.  She loves it.,5
"I have a nice little collection of sealing wax stamps but this one is one of my favorites, especially for the money. It's super high quality and the stamp is nice and big. The only problems is WHERE CAN I GET MORE WAX?",5
The Game of Thrones Wax Seal is a must have item for GoT fans. You can use this wax seal for invitation to your next Game of Thrones themed viewing party. The envelopes and scrolls are simple and not that impressive. The sealing wax is good. The Hand of the King Seal is heavier and better quality than I expected. It's quite substantial and a heavy metal seal. I highly recommend this item.,5
This is my first attempt at a wax seal and this GoT stamp kit is great! The seal came out perfect the first time! I love that this includes a black velvet pouch to store the seal.,5
"This was a gift so I can't go into detail, but it was well received, so, 5 stars.",5
"So cute and sturdy looking.  The covers are not hardcover, but they are made of a thick durable looking plastic.  The notebooks are lined nicely and there is a back pocked where you can keep small thing like coupons or whatever.  Maybe a couple bucks over priced.  I have seen similiar ones at Walmart for about 5.00$ but these are a little nicer.",5
"This notebook is flexible enough to fit into a handbag while sturdy enough not to get banged around or bent up while in there. The paper is smooth and nice to write on. I don't use the rubber band closure at all, and I worried it would get it my way, but it lies flat at the back of the cover and doesn't cause any bumps or lumps in the writing surface. I will definitely be buying this product again.",5
I was looking for a new journal and this one is absolutely perfect! Not too small but can easily fit into my purse. I love the spiral on it. It enables me to write closer to the end of each page .,5
Love it,5
Great for journal and sketches. Glad I bought it.,5
"great quality, I would order this again for myself or as a gift. bold vibrant colors and quality paper! Also had little pocket in the back for small notes or business cards A+++",5
Lovely note card set!  Perfect for a quick note to say hi and let someone know you are thinking of them.  The envelopes are cute and a nice touch too with the dots and pink outlines.  The quality is good on the cards and envelopes.  I will definitely be ordering more of these!,5
Great for short notes.,5
Beautiful cards. Just what I needed!,5
Very pretty. I've used them at work.,5
Very pretty stationary set.  Using this for a wedding shower activity and am very pleased to see how nice they look.  Arrived well packaged and pristine.  Thank you!,5
They are beautiful!,5
perfect,5
FINALLY RE-MASTERED with ALL of the SUBTLETIES the BEATLES Originally Intended.,5
it's the Beatles what else is there to say!,5
"Excellent CD.  I grew up in this era, yet it's new to me.  Love it.  Thanks.",5
I wanted to buy this album for such a long time but I will be honest i haven't played it on my record player just yet because I am unsure if I want to open the seal on it. I'm debating if I want to open it or keep it as a collectable.,5
"This wasn't the first LP I wore out -- that was ABBEY ROAD -- but this was the first CD I wore out!  Wonderful, innovative music that sent pop into a new, more sophisticated stratosphere than the jingles and Delta blues mashups that had been the going thing beforehand.  If you already have a copy, consider buying a copy for someone who was not yet alive when the Beatles broke up.  To understand them, listen to them, especially this album.",5
play this almost EVERY day!,5
Great!,5
Awesome,5
Proven,5
"Stupid me... sold the original vinyl a few year ago.  Needed this one to forget.  No problem.  Exactly what I needed, and delivered in an incredibly short time.",5
no mp3 download with it,5
great,5
An amazing album by an amazing band!,5
Great album. Packaged well and love the heavier weight,5
Sounds great!,5
Simply the best!  Nuff said! !!,5
just great,5
All Beatles' music is beyond wonderful and this is the Beatles at their best -- at the top of their game.  This vinyl album is for those who prefer the album be as it was when released.,5
CLASSIC!!!!!,5
Vintage Beatles - a must-have,5
Great cd with excellent sound quality,5
"My favorite Beatles album was and is Revolver. To me Rubber Soul was at the time just the next Beatles album. Revolver raised the bar and I could barely wait to see what was next, especially after Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane single. I bought it & prepared myself for the musical experience of my life. I found the album to be very disappointing. I tried listening g again & again under different stimulus and while liked it enough for me it wasn't the revelation Revolver was & while I love all the Beatles music this is about middle on my list of their albums. That said every Beatles album is mandatory listening &  the new analogue mono vinyl pressings along with the Mobile Fidelity versions are the absolute best out there. But you can get the entire mono catalogue for about the price of a sealed mfsl With The Beatles so this is definatly the way to go. Perfect sound & dead quiet between the tracks.",5
Excellent,5
"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is a very entertaining album.  Well, that's what you want, right?  One buys music to be entertained.  The Sergeant does NOT disappoint.

Songs here run the gamut from the jaunty fun of When I'm 64 to the psychedelic drug tragedy of A Day in the Life.  This album has it all including a 40 piece orchestra.  Rock was never the same once The Beatles opened up.",5
great,5
What can I say?  Beatles music is classic and this is one of their best.  You can't beat the sound of their tunes.,5
"The Beatles grabbed the consciousness of a generation and played a near shaman's role in moving that generation toward maturity.

Their music led that generation into and through a liminal world .  Entranced the generation listened, were moved, entered different states, got lucky and then went home changed.

At their start, we were teddy bears; at their end, we were doing it in the road.

This disc marks a midpoint in their and our transformations: this is a disk of pure joy.",5
"their MOST revolutionary lp. changed the course of serious music. the intro is a rocker from paul which segues into a very sweet
paen to friendship & weed, hallmarks of the '60s. ringo gives this his everyman's vocal. lucy rips the listener into the stratosphere of
serious drugs...but avers john, gorgeousity is to be found there too. getting better & fixing a hole unfortunately prove to be McCartney
filler. she's leaving home, however, with a page taken from yesterday & Eleanor rigby, is the agonizing beauty of a string quintet
limning a young woman's sexual rebellion. mr kite is both a whopping joy and a very difficult new exercise in electronic rock programs.
within you is exquisite. indian classical merged with occidental music. George's great contribution. 64 is paul taking a spin down memory lane - ballroom dancing, perhaps to really set this album on edge. rita is a mildly humourous rocker. good morning is a
musical postcard of a british breakfast...& the lp segues into the pepper reprise, really juiced up...but it is short, for the magnum opus
is now heard...a day in the life, 2 druggy elegies parted by 2 hairraising orchestral crescendos AND McCartney's short drugged
day in the life in the midst. the final chord is overwhelming.",5
"This enhanced stereo CD is by far the best stereo version of this famous CD. The only CD of this that I would rate higher is the original mono mix that only comes in the ""Mono Box Set"" for $160.00. You can save your money and get this, the best stereo version ever mixed!",5
"No collection would be complete without this all time favorite Beatles album, classic tunes and a turning point for the group, classic!!!",5
"Each Beatles record was an advance and a revelation of some sort.  Each album introduced something creative and new. Sgt. Pepper, however, rose above the rest.  It represented a quantum leap beyond what had gone before, beginning with the cover.  It was an explosion of imagery and artistry and innovation from beginning to end.  (That might not be apparent now, over 40 years later, as the innovative techniques which the Beatles inspired and pioneered have become commonplace.)  The lyrics, the tunes, the voices, the harmonies, the instruments, the orchestrations and the technical wizardry of George Martin all conspired to reflect the spirit of the time.  This might be best embodied in the aural perfection of the closing ""A Day in the Life.""  The album continues to amaze me.  When you buy Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, as you should, turn down the lights, turn up the sound, and just listen.  It's a trip!",5
"I had this on vinyl when I was a teenager and had made a cassette recording in the early 80s.  Regretfully, I traded the album in to a record store (a bunch of them, actually) for a few new tapes.

Good to hear this in its entirity again, and prefer to own the CD over just a digital download to an MP3 player.  This allows me to put it on my MP3/iTunes and still play the CD in the home or car stereo.  Just my preference.

I like the cardboard presentation over the plastic jewel case and appreciate that it wasn't taped so tightly shut so I didn't have to rip or tear it to get it open.",5
"book enclosed has the info from the original vinyl. Need a magnifying glass to read the names of the characters behind the fab 4 on the famous cover!

This is NOT packed in a plastic case, this is formatted in a card-board case.",5
"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Good price and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is fun to sing while driving,",5
"Was real reluctant to order after reading about all the QC problems from the pressing plant. And now awaiting my 3rd copy of Rubber Soul trying to get a unwarped and unscratched example.

On to Sgt Pepper-- This is a real fine copy, and the sound is rich, warm and full. What really pops out at you is the quality of the bass response. Plentiful, not muddy sounding and tight. It truly make the experience complete.",5
"This CD brought back a lot of memories since I grew up in the 60""s. I also bought their Yellow Submarine which had some songs I had not heard or forgot.",5
"The Beatles were my main musical influence throughout my teenage years. Sgt. Peppers changed the way I listened to music...from a mostly aesthetic (artistic) appreciation to a more thoughtful consideration of the lyric and technical production. Wa-la! A musician/singer/songwriter/audio engineer was born. Well, at least the embryonic stage of development had begun.",5
"The Beatles/ Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:  I'm perfectly happy with my old CD version of this nearly perfect album.  There is no need for me to describe this album to you.  If you don't have a copy, you need to get one.  Having this version of the CD for a long time, I have yet to see a reason to replace it with a newer CD.  This album would obviously earn the sixth star in this rating system.",5
"""Sgt. Pepper"" is arguably the Beatles most recognized album. Released in 1967 at the peak of the 'hippy/flower power' movement, it combined art with music in a way that no album had previously done. From the way upbeat, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" to the surreal, somewhat somber, ""A Day In The Life"", every song is a classic. The sound is what makes this album amazing. George Martin and his son remastered and remixed several songs for the ""Love"" album. This same remarkable remastering has revitalized ""Sgt. Pepper's"" to an unbelievable clarity. Mixed with an array of sound effects, the remastering not only enhances the instruments and vocals, but brings all those art/music sound effects throughout the album to a vivid height. It's really remarkable how great this album sounds.

Also included in the great album is a multi-paged booklet with some excellent liner notes. There is also a diagram identifying all the famous people in the cover photo! On your computer, you can play the five-minute mini-documentary about the album (Quick-time), which showcases comments from all four Beatles and George Martin. All of this is mixed in with rare photos never seen before. Imagine learning that this album was recorded at night with over 400 hours devoted to it. That's perfectionism and its shows. In fact, there is a mini-documentary for all the Beatles albums. This CD is a collector's item and a perfect showcase for the Beatles genius.",5
"Apple records announced today, that the remastered editions of the entire BEATLES catalouge will be released on SEPTEMBER 9th, 2009. (NUMBER 9, NUMBER 9, NUMBER 9, of course!) So, for those of you who have NEVER bought any of the Beatles CDs, PLEASE WAIT!  The Beatle's music was very late, as far as ALBUM CLASSICS go, for their original CD mastering.  Nothing was released until around 1987, which means the digital quality is  what was current, over 20 years ago. If you compair the digital bit rates, to PIXEL DEPTH of a photograph or TV, then you are compairing a picture of the MONA LISA made from 8 pixels per square inch, with a photo of the Mona Lisa made from 100,000 pixels per square inch. Now, we have that HIGH DEFINITION, 24 bit remastering. All the warmth of Analouge is preserved, with the clarity of digital.  FINALLY the Beatles will release their ENTIRE CATALOUGE remastered. PLUS, each album will have a quick time movie, that shows HOW the album was made, little audio outtakes, etc. PLUS, past masters 1 and 2 are going to be united to ONE CD, and....THE MONO EDITIONS WILL BE RELEASED AS WELL!!!! (Finally, the MONO SGT PEPPER ALBUM, MONO WHITE ALBUM, MONO REVOLVER ALL ON CD!!!!!) OKAY, so now that we know to WAIT until September to buy the SGT PEPPER ALBUM, i just want to put my two cents into the reason why THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER RECORDED.

  Most people have heard so much about the Beatles, and this album, that they have formed an opinion about it, often without ever having heard the album.  This was true back in 1980 with some of my friends, and it's still true today.  Now that this album is 42 years old, you would think it would be at least SOMEWHAT dated. Much from the 60s DOES SOUND dated, but the Beatle's work does not. It truly DOES tap into the eternal beauty of the human soul.  Sgt. Pepper is often credited as the first ""artrock"" album, and first ""Concept album"" as well.  John Lennon used to INSIST that this was a  concept album, without a concept. But the concept is almost TOO SIMPLE to see.  It contains a very obvious concept: THE BANALITY OF MODERN DAY LIFE.  The whole idea of ""Psychedelic music"", was to return ""technicolor"" back to a drab and dreary world, to make the monotony of WORK, HOME, EAT, SLEEP, WAKE UP, WORK, HOME, EAT, SLEEP, or the monotonous rites of passage like, MARRIAGE (when i'm 64), Leaving home (SHE's LEAVING HOME), going to church (WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU), and death (A DAY IN THE LIFE, which talks about the death in a car crash, in warfare, etc.) Either way you look at it, life can be a DRAG, a dull, boring, tedious DRAG. The beatles were really fighting against......A DULL AND BORING LIFE. Each song deals with an aspect of daily life, that artists had tried to elevate the human awareness beyond, especially since the romantic movement, and the rediscovery of mind expanding drugs into our culture.  SGT PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB, is a song about the isolation of the human experience....we are ALL loney, ALL unable to really connect with the OTHER. BUT, the idea of Psychedelic drugs, was that you could mind merge with your fellow trippers, and become a BAND with each other, and ONE with the universe. SURE, it does sound a bit trite now, a bit pseudo utopian in these days of terrorism, crackheads and meth heads, and DEATH CENTERED video games, which have replaced the hippie idealism. BUT, are we better off SPIRITUALLY today? For that matter, SOCIALLY? Or MATERIALLY? Well, not really.  IN fact, we are closer to this existencial isolation of the human TODAY, than we were 40 years ago.  The Beatles created an album of closely related songs, that examined the Generation Gap, which is really the GAP between the HIP, and the HYPED. How many people today, live a life where they are CONSTANTLY HYPED, into buying a new computer game, iPod, iPhone, etc?  These hypes, are just as empty, and lifeless, as the materialistic hypes from that era.

This album CHALLENGES YOU to elevate your awareness....not nessacarily with drugs, but with a bigger picture of HOW IT ALL GOES TOGETHER.  Anyone of us, can elevate ourselves like the Beatles did, when they put on the costumes of a typical ""psychedelic San Fransesco hippie Band"", grew out their hair, and studied eastern spirituality, as a way to see that the world is SO MUCH MORE than daily awareness lets us know about. This ""awareness"" was long the priviledge of the artists, but by 1967 EVERYBODY could join the party. Once you joined the ""SGT PEPPER LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND"", and reinvented yourself, you could GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP OF YOUR FRIENDS. (Join a commune, or a meditation group.) ANd, you could see new visions, like LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS. (A childLIKE vision, based on Jesus' saying that no one enters Heaven, unless they become LIKE CHILDREN.)  That is the REAL idea here. Lennon based the song on a child's world, his 7 year old son's drawing of a woman in the stars. Then, once you did this, life would start GETTING BETTER.  If something was raining on your world, making life a drag, instead of complaining, you just go up on the roof, and start FIXING A HOLE. Then, you remove yourself from the world of dull, backward looking people. SHE""S LEAVING HOME was the parents perspective, of a daughter doing just that....leaving behind parents that controlled her thru guilt (We gave her most of our lives....SURE mom and dad, SURE you did.) THEN, the woman joins the band, and marches right into what Herman Hesse called ""The Circus of the Mind"". And tonight the Circus is FOR THE BENEFIT OF MISTER KITE, as we fly HIGHER and HIGHER into a phasmagorical dreamland, shooting stars twirling into colorful sparks, that you may NEVER want to leave. What does the ""experience"" Teach? George Harrison thought that life always keeps going on, WITHIN YOU AND WITHOUT YOU. (The squares laugh at the end of this song, all about eastern spirituality, complete with sitars, tablas, and the first real visions of GLOBALIZATION applied to a new sound: World music.)  If the album ONLY had George's magnum opus on it, it would STILL be one of the greatest rock songs ever. After you get your head together, with a little help of the CIRCUS of the MIND, and some Transcendental Meditation/eastern Mystisicm, you still had to wonder about what life would be like, in 40 years. Would the lover you have in your youth, love you for MORE than your beauty? Will I be loved WHEN I""M SIXTY FOUR? Sure, even those people who tried to BE HERE NOW, thought of the future.  Even if you were hip, you STILL had to work, just like LOVELY RITA the Meter maid. (Another strike at the military industrial complex, cos RITA looked a little like a MILITARY MAN.) SURE, you may become aware of the TRUTH,  but you STILL have to get up  tomorrow, and face another day, pour your cornflakes and milk, and say GOODMORNING GOODMORNING to the blahs of the working week. BUT WAIT!! THe circle is always coming around again, as the time comes to meet up with your friends who help you get high, and see the VISIONS again, and again, and again....each day become another DAY IN THE LIFE, until all the days are past, and we DIE. BUT, before we die without knowing that another way of seeing the world exists out there, the Beatles want to do something for you, they would LOVE TO TURN YOU ON!  Oh yes, yes they would, and they STILL  want to do that.  Fourty years later, and i cant think of a SINGLE album that sums up the world, and life, and death, and all the circles within circles we pass thru,  all the stages of life, all the joys, and sorrows, all the boredoms and ecstacies, the way SGT PEPPER does. Is it the BEST music, that the Beatle's recorded? Well, song by song, maybe not. I still like the WHITE ALBUM a bit better, just cos the songs were a bit more centered.  But if ART REFLECTS LIFE, and if LIFE is about the BEAUTIFUL and the DULL, the YIN AND YANG, being BORN again (as a new BAND, or persona), and DYING (to the self, or to the world), then this ""Sgt. Pepper"" world recreats what other poets couldn't achieve thru PAGES and PAGES of obtuse poems meant for the educated, privledged few. NOW, this is a TRUE ART, produced for ALL PEOPLE...and like all TRUE ART, it isn't about the PAST. It's about NOW. BECAUSE THE HUMAN CONDISTION IS ALWAYS THE SAME. WE might decorate our lives a bit differently. Maybe telephones are smaller, or you can watch a million different movies on your BIG SCREEN TV, but its the SAME LIFE, the same people living it.  ONE THING IS FOR SURE....if you think that this was your PARENTS/GRANDPARENTS music, or whatever, then you might as well never listen to MOZART, cos it was your GREAT GREAT GREATx3 GRANDPARENTS MUSIC, or not listen to the sitar, because its music for somebody else's ancestors. If we have REALLY come to the point, where we cant find TRUTH, BEAUTY and ENLIGHTENMENT unless it comes packaged as a BRAND NEW VIDEO GAME, which needs a $300 new control unit, and a $75 program, and a $800 HI DEF TV screen, then I really feel sorry for the world today, and the kids coming up. BECAUSE, for the price of a MOVIE, this album gives you MORE ENTERTAINMENT, than a hundred video games, which grow old, as soon as the next version comes out in a couple of years, or a new RAP star, who also becomes old, as soon as the newer face comes on the scene. SGT PEPPER has a message. Yes, we are ALL UNITED, by our COMMUNAL LIFE DRAMAS, DISAPPOINTMENTS, DREAMS, and VISIONS.  It is the voice of the ETERNAL SHAMAN, and if we no longer listen to THAT voice, then life IS A DRAG.

If you are just TOO COOL, and TOO KNOWLEDGABLE to get into this CD, cos you know ALL ABOUT WHAT IT IS, even if you never heard it, then you are very closed minded. OPEN YOUR MIND. As for the music on this album, it is every bit as fresh now, as when it was made. MUSIC PRODUCERS to this day have no idea how all this sound got onto a 4 track tape.  It should sound as lo-fi as Half Japanese. Instead, there is so much happening, that you could listen to it all your life, and NEVER hear everything. BECAUSE GREAT ART CHANGES WITH YOU, and renews itself WITH YOU, because its part of the ETERNAL CHANGING NOW.  And, if you need ANY MORE PERSUASION, just wait until SEPT 9th, 2009, and hear the NEW REMASTERING. AMAZON.com aren't placing pre-orders yet, but as soon as they do, I'm there. PEACE.",5
"It's just my opinion but this album might just be the greatest assemblage of The  Beatles' work ever produced. Sgt. Pepper represents their middle period of counterculture Classic Rock music and may well be the top rock album of the entire 20th Century, (and of the 21st, so far!).

My favorite cut is ""With a Little Help from My Friends,"" a very melodic and period typical love-one-another tune. I was similarly bowled over by Joe Cocker's (slower) version of this composition which he sang live at Woodstock.

Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, who was so impressed with Sgt. Pepper, tried with a Herculean effort to generate an album of this magnitude when, in response, he produced ""Pet Sounds"". It was good, but didn't come close to manifesting the brilliance of this Beatles masterpiece. (EDIT! Well, it turns out that this paragraph is erroneous! See ""comments"" on this review where someone much shrewder than I got it right -- still it SOUNDS good *.* )

Paul McCartney plays a very busy Hoffner bass guitar on this one and his innovative rhythms sort of set the pace for the entire work. The harmonies are as spectacular here as they are on any Beatles album that exists.

This album/CD virtually screams out THE BEATLES!!! and I cannot think of a better Classic Rock investment which one could make.",5
"SGT. PEPPER'S RE-ISSUED EXACTLY LIKE THE ORIGINAL 1967 VINYL RELEASE ,PLUS A POSTER ! Lyrics in English and Japanese, Special Inserts within THIS Japanese Import DigiPak Eeition.",5
"What can I say? Rolling Stone's #1 Rock album of all time.

Maybe less appealing to Britney Spears-type listeners, this album was ahead of it's time in so many ways that I can't list here.",5
"It is impossible to adequately explain to someone not around forty years ago when this album was released its importance and what it meant to so many of us. The Beatles were at their height. In the U. S., it was before the assassinations of Malcolm X, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King when all the world seemed young and everything was possible. It was more than just world class music, it was a social and cultural phenomenon. There had never been anything just quite like it before. It helped define the 1960's.

The music of course is of one cloth as each song seques into the next one. No song stands out above another although my favorite has always been ""When I'm Sixy-four."" It now has a poignancy that we never dreamed of in those our salad days since neither George Harrison or John Lennon lived to see sixty-four. Then there was a whole generation of men, many who grew up with the Beatles, who perished in the first wave of AIDS.

Besides the marvelous music, there is of course the artwork for the album/CD. According to the liner notes by Peter Blake, he asked the Beatles for a list of people they would want at an imaginary concert. John initially wanted to include Jesus, Ghandi and Hitler but eventually left all three off the list because of the controversy in the U. S. over his recent comment about Jesus. Some of the people who made the list were Marlene Dietrich, Shirley Temple, Marlon Brando, Bob Dylan, Dylan Thomas, Edgar Allen Poe, Tony Curtis, William Burroughs, Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde, Johnny Weismuller, Stephen Crane, Albert Einstein, and Mae West (who refused at first but eventually agreed to be included in the life-size collage.)

It is impossible to write about either popular music or the popular culture of the last half of the twentieth century without a discussion of this CD. It should be placed in a time capsule.",5
"this album created the legacy of the 'concept' album. No longer was an album all about selling singles it was about the collective soul of the songs. Very few albums have more soul then Sgt Pepper's even after 40 years. The story goes that the Beatles were blown away by 'Pet Sounds' by the Beach Boys which in their minds far surpassed anything that popular music had come up with. Their answer to 'Pet Sounds' was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club. With the creative genuis of producer George Martin the Beatles put together an album that belongs in any aspiring Beatles fan collection. The White Album, Revolver and The Anthology are all great but this I think stands as the pinnacle of the Beatles music.",5
"I won't even pretend that I could write an objective review about this work because every song is so tied  up with many memories of that time in my life, with this music always (it seemed)playing in the background. The Beatles were a seminal musical force in my life and their lyrics and arrangements resonated deeply with me.

  I do, however, have one suggestion. Even if Paul was never your favorite ""Beatle"", check out his newest work ""Memory Almost Full."" It is the most recent Cd that I think hearkens back to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and it is likely to give you an attack of nostalgia, since he sings of times gone by - at least, in some songs.  The musical arrangements are very similar, too.",5
"The Beatles' SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is a finely painted multi-colored musical canvas that came out in the summer of 1967.  The record further enhanced The Beatles sound and presence within rock and roll, and for the most part, musical history.  Pause for a moment and imagine listening to this album for the first time within the context of the time in which it was created.  There is no doubt that this was yet another leap that the band took forward to craft and reinvent their musical skills.  This is the Beatles and not the Wrecking Crew.

All of the songs are melodic and poetic in nature.  With the enclosed lyrics and a little insight about how each song was derived, each composition conjures an array of colors and creations derived from their personal lives, a cereal box, a child's painting, a circus poster, and newspaper headlines.  Each song sounds like John, Paul, George, and Ringo were having a good time, and this can be heard with the title track, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" the reprise, ""With a little help from my friends,"" ""Getting Better,"" ""Lovely Rita,"" and ""When I'm Sixty-Four.""  Always the contemplative member, George also adds a tinge of eastern sounds with ""Within You, Without You."" However, the capstone song on the record is John's ""A Day in a Life.""

Whatever one may take out from listening to SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, one thing rings true, it was and still is an influential and inspirational album that is absolutely timeless.  So, the most effective way to hear the album is with the headphones, and for album art aficionados, the most effective way to look at the album is to own a vinyl copy as well.",5
"Back in the late 1960's, my life revolved around music. Although I wasn't a musician, many of my friends were. My involvement was on the technical side and I recorded many local bands using the primative recording equipment of the time.

That aside, I can remember the first time that I heard Sgt. Pepper as though it was yesterday. It was a Saturday afternoon and I was at home listening to music.

That's when a few musician friends showed up with the just released Sgt. Pepper album. They had already listened to it but wanted to hear it on my system which was pretty much state of the art back then.

After ""setting the mood"", so to speak, I put the album on the turntable and we all kicked back to listen. During the entire playing, nobody said a word. Nobody needed to.

We had just heard what we felt was the greatest album ever made. We must have listened to it 6 more times and always found something new. A sound that we hadn't heard before. A new interpretation of a lyric. I even recorded it and we listened to it backwards.

Over the years I wore out two vinyl copies of the disc. I hadn't replaced the second copy and many years went by without my listening to the album in its entirety.

About a year ago I bought the CD version. I've copied it to my MP3 player and it's even on my computer at work. Amazingly, the sound quality of the CD isn't all that much better (if at all) than the original vinyl.

I no longer ""set the mood"" before listening to music, but that hasn't in any way lessened my enjoyment of what I still think may be the greatest album of its time.",5
"I remember as an eight-year-old child cranking up the scratchy vinyl copy on the old black rainbow Capitol record label on my parents ""console"" stereo and loving it.  I must say that it really awakened my interest in music.  I didn't ""get it"" then like the way I do now, but it didn't matter.  It was fascinating to listen to and one of the few vivid memories from that time in my life.

Now my six year old is listening to it on CD, and I suppose when I turn 64 in 2024 I'll listen to it on my music archive chip player (or maybe vinyl will totally come back by then) and enjoy the joke that I had arrvied at an age I thought inconceivable back when I first heard the song.  And, probably on that same day hundreds if not thousands of people will be listening to this album too.

That's because it truly is a classic.  I define ""classic"" as something that will be listened to for an indefinite time in the future, possibly centuries.  On this day 100 years from now someone will likely be listening to this recording, either in a solar powered tower with a holographic beatles concert simulator or perhaps in a dystopian slum on an old vinyl record player that survived world war four and five.

So, just kick back with a good sound system and enjoy it.  It doesn't pay to think too much or try to decode all the hidden messages or worry about whether or not it's better than Pet Sounds or whether it would even exist without Pet Sounds coming first.  And it also doesn't pay to worry about whether or not it's the ""best"" Beatles album.  It is what it is, that's all.

Oh yeah, now that we are somewhere around the 40th anniversary of this recording, I hope that some anniversary package is in the works.  You know, remastered with bonus tracks and delux packaging.  That would be cool.  And one thing I'll say for the vinyl: it's a whole lot easier to look at all the faces and figure out who they are.",5
"It seems after decades, 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' would be the all-time chart topper for best rock album of all time.  While The Beatles innovated music with every effort they created, 'Sgt. Pepper' should be viewed as their most creative and ground-breaking album.  However, as great as it is, it isn't, subjectively, their best.

The false start and the blaring guitars that herald the album with a show tune accompanied by able brass is certainly an ear opener even today.  It starts out the show, a carnival, but it does have some side shows as well.  There are segues throughout, and the special effects elevated The Beatles to the stature of artists in a way only looked at in retrospect on 'Revolver' and 'Rubber Soul'  (Thankfully, the latter classics have in some ways surpassed 'Pepper''s reputation.)  ""With a Little Help from My Friends,"" one of the very best songs on the album, melds in with the title song and is still one of their best pop classics of all time.  While ""Lucy in the Skies with Diamonds"" and ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" continue the carnival perfection, they also date the album somewhat.  Some of the other highlights of the album include ""When I'm Sixty Four,"" with the beginning of Paul's stretch of vaudevillian numbers.  Then, ""Lovely Rita"" is ethereal and entertaining.  John is quite able to lift the veil off the conventional world with ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" (based on a Kellogg's Corn Flake Commercial).  Just before the tent folds up, The Beatles deliver the better and more fluid reprise to ""Sgt. Pepper"" just before they end with a remarkable finale.

All The Beatles try to showcase a new consciousness with songs like Paul's ""Getting Better"" and ""Fixing a Hole"".  George gets his turn with the deep, spiritual realm of ""Within You and Without You"".  (And, while it is sincere, articulate, and perceptive, it doesn't fit the album musically as well as ""Love You To"" does on 'Revolver'.)  Paul certainly adds depth with his contribution ""She's Leaving Home,"" almost a classical piece with tear-jerking lyrics and a story that challenges class differences like 'Lady Chatterly's Lover'.  The finale, ""A Day in the Life,""  is the most celebrated song.  It is the grandest musically and lyrically transcending the ordinary values of life.  The song remains innovative and awe-inspiring.

Overall, The Beatles brought the most innovations to pop music on 'Sgt. Pepper'.  The music is meant to rise above conventional consciousness.  In this sense it can be regarded as a concept album that has some diversions along the way.  Still, 'Sgt. Pepper' is a period piece, one that is magnificent, but is their most dated.  It does come from 1967 and, for better or worse, seems locked in time.  They abandoned the drugs and the magical studio effects, but went ahead later with 'The White Album,' another masterpiece that is more decidedly rock, but without much compromise.  (Like 'Pepper' they did what they really wanted.)  This is a magnificent, but flawed masterpiece.",5
"This is a recording packed with loads of good old fashioned Beatle lore.  Paul-is-dead-lore, The Beatles are the next Mozarts lore, The Beach Boys scared the Beatles back into the studios lore (this is true...just ask Sir Paul McCartney, who is of course alive and well, thank you very much, and on his gazillionteenth tour with Lady Heather and baby Bea in tow)...and in the Days of Vinyl it took turns being called ""the greatest"" along with ""Abbey Road"".  Being knee-high to a cicadid when the Beatles were at their height, but nonetheless a huge fan, I knew them from AM radio, not albums.  So I never knew which songs were on which lps until high school, when our team-tought humanities instructors (see my ""So You'd Like to be a Pseudo-Expert in Western Culture"" list) gave their infamous ""Sgt. Pepper"" Lecture!  Aha, thinks I, This is An Important Record!

And it was.  Many thought it was the first album with a theme (although Brian Wilson's ""Pet Sounds"" beat the Beatles to that punch). And ""the boys"" continued to show influences as far flung as British music-hall and Indian classical music.  Put together, it was nothing less than delightful.  And just think, it was sixty years ago today, or something like that....",5
"One of the greatest albums I ever heard. Unbelievable songwriting. Instead of ripping off American R&B and Rock artists they truly have their own sound with this album. Even though this wasn't the first concept album, this is the blueprint for all concept albums to follow.",5
"Amazon considers this to be one of its essential recordings for music fans because it IS fantastic! This album is a must for Beatles' fans as well as fans of 60's rock.

To begin with, the CD cover draws you in--what an awesome collection of faces and characters! Colorful and regal, The Beatles stand out in front of the crowd and you just know the music on the album will be superior--and it is! As people have noted time and again, this album has several classic songs that should be ranked among the best rock songs ever. The CD starts out strong with ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and goes straight into the emotional ""With a Little Help From My Friends."" Then there's infamous ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,"" about tripping on drugs--an experience many people can relate to as well. ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" is probably my personal favorite on the CD; but it was a tough choice between that song and ""With A Little Help From My Friends.""

The song ""She's Leaving Home"" is very beautiful and it has great insight into teen angst still common today. Truly, all the songs on the CD are great, including ""Getting Better"" and ""Lovely Rita.""

The CD ends with first the reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and then the incredibly strong hit ""A Day In The Life."" If you're not familiar with this music and you like classic rock then the CD is a must if only for the last song.

The CD comes with extensive liner notes--a huge plus! You get all the lyrics to the songs as well as photos of the band. There is a complete listing of who's who on the CD cover, and dates and recording locations of the songs. The notes include mention of the ""15 kilocycle tone, put there--especially to annoy your dog,"" and the concluding ""few seconds of...Beatle chatter."" Listen for it!

All in all, the set of songs on this CD reflects incredible talent, thought and hard work by The Beatles. A must have for any rock fan who especially likes the 60's sounds as well as of course for a Beatles `fan. Enjoy it! GRIN",5
"Rolling Stone Magazine rated Sgt. Peppers as the number one rock album of all time.  I heartily concur because no album changed the face of Rock-N-Roll more.  For the first time, Rock music was capable of being more than mere dance music -- it was to be listened to and digested.  Where the Beatles first album took 10 hours to record, this took 700 hours and 129 days.  The sound of every instrument is in some way altered:  instruments and voices are compressed, limited, and echoed.  Violins were recorded by taking headphones and using them as microphones.  Microphones were dropped down the bells of horn instruments.  Voices were played through the whirling speakers inside a Hammond organ.  This was the the first ""concept album"" where the songs on each side of the vinyl did not have pauses between them.  Thank you Sir George Martin!
The songs themselves are very good.  The last song on the album, ""A Day in the Life,"" is John Lennon's materpiece.  The title song, Sgt. Peppers, etc., is one of Paul's niftiest pieces.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, is a great psychedelic song which we thought described an LSD trip.  Actually, it described a picture that John Lennon's son drew in school ""consist[ing] of a young girl floating in the air with a couple of childishly drawn stars beside her."" We certainly didn't think so when we heard about those cellophane flowers of yellow and green!  The rest of the album is filled with some fine McCartney ballads and other assorted psychedelic rock/pop tunes by Lennon and Harrison.
While I consider this album to be the number one album of all time, it is hopelessly mired in that alternative consciousness of the '60s.  It has not aged as well as the White Album, Abbey Road or even the Phil Spectorized ""Let it Be.""  Still, it is great listening.  I just hope they release it soon on SACD or DVD-Audio.",5
"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is, in my opinion, the most historically important album ever released.  This album revolutionized the rock and roll industry; often imitated but never duplicated, it continues to exert a significant influence on the very business of singing and recording music.  Even the timing of the album was perfect; the year was 1967, the Summer of Love, and this album captured the spirit of the times in such an amazing fashion that other recording artists immediately recognized the profound significance of what the Beatles had just succeeded in doing.  I remember seeing an interview with David Crosby, who basically said that Sgt. Pepper accomplished what he and so many other artists of that war-torn generation had been trying to achieve themselves - musically, artistically, and culturally.
There had never been an album like Sgt. Pepper's before 1967.  Before then, an album was simply a collection of songs; since Sgt. Pepper's, an album has been looked upon as more than the sum of its parts.  The Beatles were determined to break new ground, putting in an estimated 700 hours in the studio to produce the thirteen songs you find here (three additional songs were also recording during the Sgt. Pepper sessions but went on to be released separately: Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, and It's Only a Northern Song) .  The amazing stereo sound was borne of carefully placed microphones all over the studio, including the insides of instruments.  All manner of mixing, tape speed manipulation, and other elaborate technological twists were done to the recordings to make each of them sound unlike anything ever heard before.  There were no breaks between songs, so each side of the original long-playing record played without pausing from beginning to end.  In the case of the second side, you could even say that there was no end to the music; John Lennon, after adding several seconds of a high-pitched tone near the end of A Day in the Life, had several seconds of inane chatter stuck at the very end - this chatter played over and over again in one continuous groove until the listener lifted the needle (unless the record player featured auto return).  The historic evolution of the album went far beyond the individual song tracks.  The album cover, featuring a gallery of familiar men and women is famous in and of itself - as much for those individuals who were rejected as too controversial as it is for the faces you do see (many of whom had to be paid for the use of their likenesses).  Sgt. Pepper was also the first album to come with the lyrics of the songs printed on the sleeve.
You can already see the importance of this album, and I haven't even discussed the song selection yet.  What's to say, really, when every single track is a classic?  The title track gets the music off to a rousing start before bridging smoothly into With a Little Help From My Friends featuring Ringo on lead vocals.  Then you have John's remarkable Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.  Paul jumps out front on Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, and She's Leaving Home, followed up by John on Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite.  The next track is the most unusual song on the album: George Harrison's Within You Without You.  At first, this song - with its Oriental, psychedelic sound - doesn't seem to fit in with the surrounding songs, but all it takes is a couple of listens to see just how important the track is to the album itself.  Next comes Paul with the jaunty When I'm Sixty-Four, followed by Lovely Rita, the most entertaining and enjoyable song on the album in my opinion.  After John says Good Morning, Good Morning, the band is back for a reprise of the title track and an encore of sorts in the form of A Day in the Life, a particularly unusual track that changes drastically in terms of sound and singer midway through.
It is hard to do justice to this album in words; as important and influential as it is enjoyable to listen to over and over again, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band represents The Beatles at its very best, and this CD really should find a home somewhere in the collections of music lovers everywhere.",5
13 Beatles Classics!!! A Masterpiece!!! A+,5
"""Lovely Rita (Metermaid)"", ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" and ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds""--for these three hits alone, any Beatle fan needs this album. Along with ""Abbey Road"" and ""Magical Mystery Tour"", I think this makes a core set of Beatles for anyone who loves them. Oops, have to add the White Album to that list.
When I looked at a Linda Eastman McCartney photo of the Beatles that hangs in the shop where I get my hair cut, it struck me that two of the four are now gone. How sad that is. How wonderful to have this cd to enjoy their music. I love this album.",5
"When thinking of music I really dig, I always wind back with Beatles tunes as part of my list. So do you. That's why you are reading my review. Maybe we can bicker about the finer points of Beatlology, but we both dig the Fab Four's music as a whole.

You probably like the Beatles, but don't know which album to get. That's what you hope the reviews will do for you. You've compared prices elsewhere, and see this is the place to buy it. Which CD?

There's ""The Beatles 1"" CD, the one with the #1 hits. A good value for a lot of songs. No bad, but, for the Beatles and a few other bands, getting the original album is a better choice. The songs are best heard in context, in an odd way, like a Pink Floyd album. Besides, on ""Sgt. Pepper,"" the songs are all incredible. A bit funky, but intensely enjoyable. A compilation won't meet the need.

I can't debate which album is the best one to buy. Too messy of a conversation. That's like arguing whether John or Paul wrote better songs. It gets you nowhere, and what you need is a Beatles album.

Why ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band""? There are 13 good reasons. The first is the title song, and the last is ""Day in the Life."" The 11 songs in between are equally classic. You know them already.

I could emote of the wonders of each song. Today, ""Lovely Rita"" is my favorite on ""Sgt. Pepper"" but tomorrow ""When I'm 64"" might be the one. Depends on the moment. But each song is completely different than the previous, meriting much value for this album.

And I haven't the room to get into it, but the pop-art of the album (take a close look at it) is fascinating. Big controversy back in its day about the cast of characters who are featured. Can you name them all?

I fully recommend ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.""

"...said anything other than great things about this CD?  This review is going to be totally boring because I am going to go on and on about how great the CD is.  So, if you want to know whether you should buy it, the answer is yes.  You don't have to read anything else or any other reviews.

Now, if you want to know which songs are the best or worst, listen to the CD!  I like every one of them.  This CD is one of those where every single song could have been released and it would have gone top 40, even though the styles run from pure pop (""Fixing a Hole"" and ""With a Little Help from My Friends) to a big band rock sound (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - OF COURSE!), to psychedelic pop (Within You, Without You - a song with the only flaw of being TOO DARN SHORT!!!).

Some of the songs are absolutely up-beat and peppy, like ""Good Morning, Good Morning,"" ""Getting Better,"" and ""Lucy and the Sky with Diamonds.""  The enthusiasm and excitement takes me back to the fun bands of the 60's jumping around on stage like a bunch of maniacs.  That was one of the many fun parts of the 60's.  There were some occasional tinges of darkness (She's Leaving Home, and somehow ""A Day in the Life"" seems a little sinister), yet somehow all this stuff fits together in one tight little beautiful package that contains some incredibly artistic music that broke a lot of ground for rock music, and for all other music too.

This CD will be one of those that will be a classic in the style of the ""1812 Overture.""  People will be referring to it in the next century and beyond!",5
"The Beatles set the bar with Revolver and Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys jumped over it with Pet Sounds.  The Beatles, especially Paul McCartney, were astounded by the album and it helped spur them to their greatest musical achievement.  While alot of people don't consider Sgt. Pepper's as the band's best album, I think the White Album is their best, the ground breaking and influential nature of it can never be denied.  Up to that point, no one thought that a pop album push the boundaries and be a cultural statement.  By creating an alter ego and using a unifying concept of attending a show by the band, the album broke all the rules.  There was not a hit single from the album and the songs merged into one another without distinction.  Even the packaging of the album broke all the rules.  Usually albums were slapped together with little or no thought to the packaging.  The band spend upwards of $100,000. on the album's artwork.  The album's cover stands as pop culture icon on its own and a true piece of art.  It was also the first album ever to contain a reprint of song lyrics.  The songs themselves have almost become irrelevant to the mystique and aura of Sgt. Peppers, but ""With A Little Help From Friends"", ""Getting Better"", ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"", ""Lovely Rita"" and most notably ""A Day In The Life"" are classics.",5
"I'm a homeschool Mom with a 6th grade child who is on the spectrum.  I supplement with Uzinggo Science, and use this a few times a week.  It's great to be able to test what he's retaining.  So many of the options out there are expensive, and you have to pay through the nose for the teacher's edition to get the answers.

I have noticed in the homeschool communities out there that people pass on Spectrum because they align with common core.  I get it, but my advice is to pass on the math if that is the case.  Don't exclude the entire series.  We have the whole group of books, the only one that hasn't impressed me is the Geography book.  I love it, it's very affordable which is a huge plus in our household!",5
Great book for basic overviews.  One page of reading on a subject.  One page answering questions about the previous page.  It's not that complicated.  It doesn't go into depth.  But it is good for extra knowledge and comprehension.,5
I liked these series.  Segments are written very well at student's reading level.  Questions insure student read through entire reading segment and understood terminology and concept.,5
"We've owned and used many wall maps over the years as students, military officers and business professionals.  This is a big, beautiful and well detailed map that was a fantastic purchase at $6.95 PRIME. It arrived in great condition and went on the wall with only surprisingly minimal curling issues to deal with.  After rolling it in the reverse direction that it was shipped, it laid nice and flat against the wall.  The colors and details are great and the map is functioning as an attractive and useful aid as we learn about the world in which we live and track the news of the day. FYI, the finish is flat, not glossy,  It takes pencil marks well and erases with minimal damage.

Lamination is nice, but adds substantially to the cost.  If you want the map laminated, call your local Fed-Ex Kinkos to see if they have a large laminating machine.  We've done this with other maps with good results.",5
I am totally addicted to anything Downton Abbey and so I was extremely happy to receive my 2016 Downton Abbey calendar. I haven't opened it yet. I don't want to spoil watching season 6. I don't want any spoilers.,5
It was sized perfectly & well colorized. Fit into our cupboard as planned. Very happy with it.,5
I gave the calendar to my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She is a big Downton Abbey fan. She loved it.,5
I love this calendar!  I have bought one every year for some time now.  Beautiful photos and interesting info about the moon.,5
Nice photos.,5
"First, this thing is very large - 4 x 6 feet. Heavy duty paper, shiney, but non-glaring, finish. Arrived without a bit of damage, well packaged in a heavy plastic tube inside a sturdy box. Since it is heavy paper, it is not hard to manuver dispite its size. It's an attractive wall hanging. Very detailed, but remember it's not a road map, major roads only. The type is easy to read without reading glasses. Our driving limit is 500 miles at a stretch, so this full size map makes it easy to rough out a cross-country road trip without having to flip pages or use more than one map. It is also interesting to see where stuff is relative to the rest of the country and our home. If you like geography, maps, or travel, and you have a large space on the wall, this is an asset.",5
"This map proved to be perfect for our needs.  It shows all the Interstate Highways.  It shows all the National Parks.  It shows US highways.  It shows state capitals.  It has shading to show mountains.  All the features like parks and roads are shown in good logical colors (not all white like some other maps).  Excellent balance of as much detail as possible, without being cluttered.",5
Exactly what I wanted and expected.,5
Really Nice,5
Perfect for cross country trip,5
Great quality map! Perfect for my needs.,5
"Nice map but check the measurements - it's HUGE.  I had trouble finding a space and if I had looked more closely, I would have purchased a smaller one!",5
Nice map!!,5
as described,5
"I bought this to put up on our big ""dream"" wall in our home. This map is very detailed and the type is very small yet legible. I will be using flag stickers for our family to each mark where they have been and where they want to go.

Born and raised in Hawaii, we don't think much about where each state is located until we have to travel. So this helps us pick a different spot every year to visit.

This is a lightweight map with a thin lamination on it. I used a regular stapler to tack this up on the wall.",5
This is a beautiful United States map. Exactly what I was looking for. I used a little spray adhesive to mount it to a sheet of foam board. You can find the foam board at any hobby shop already the same size as the map. This map is the perfect size to hang on the wall and mark where you have been or where you want to go. Map pins work great with the foam board backing. It is laminated very nice. All larger cities and hundreds of smaller cities and towns are well marked. They also did a great job with the roads and highways.,5
nice,5
"Very nice map. I'm not sure why people are saying it is laminated- the paper is nice and sturdy, but it is not laminated at least in the traditional sense. The map itself is a nice 4x6 foot sized, and the text is crisp and sharp. Lots of cities and towns are listed. I used foam core (also from amazon, needed 6 20x30 boards) to back the map, now I am able to insert push pins into the map detailing everywhere I've visited. Good map, recommended.",5
Great map! Using it to mark my travels.  Colorful and laminated too!,5
"what can i say, it is a map of the U.S.A. from National Geographic.
put down the GPS and read a map, trust me you will like it.",5
"I'm adding my 5 stars to the rest of the reviews. I searched many places to find the right large scale world map and found many that were much more expensive than this one. But this map is truly wall covering size, has a quality laminated cover, and all for a very low price. Some have commented on the color scheme (on the several similar versions on Amazon), but this is definitely not the bright colored map that would be suitable for a child's room. The actual colors are a little different than the picture, but as I sit here and look at my wall I see rich, muted browns and greens and tans. It fits well with the dark, woody, den type atmosphere I am trying to make. This is a great buy.",5
Great Map!,5
I love this map!!! I like it so much that I wish I got a bigger one hahaha,5
Mounted this map to a cork board and framed it. Have been adding pins to it every time we visit a new place. Love it!,5
I bought this as a gift for my parents and they love it. It is a beautiful map that is easy to read.,5
Gorgeous! Love it!,5
"We've traveled a lot, and wanted a large map to remind us where we've been. This one is not too big, but big enough to be easy to use for this purpose. Plus, it's beautiful, hanging on the wall.",5
Award winning map for good reason. Love the colors.,5
"Very happy with this laminated map. I got it to help visualize/plan several trips this year as we are in the college search process. It is fairly thin, but I have not found that to affect the quality of the product. I use vis-a-vis pens to map our routes, they are easy to see and wipe off cleanly. The map is big enough to easily see major cities in each state and see the state boundaries, but is not large enough to map out routes on specific roads...you'll need a more detailed map for that. I like that there is also plenty of room in the border for me to make notes as to length of drive time between our stops...it just gives a handy overview of the plans.",5
works great,5
Huge map and i like the color goes nice in my living room. I think I'm going to get the pacific centered version since I'm in the pacific duh. I use scotch removable mounting putty to hang this bad boy up.,5
Really Nice,5
"very beautiful....too cheap really, but that's great for the buyer!",5
Nice vintage looking poster. It's National Geographic so it's generally correct and high quality. This is the most up to date version.  Works great since my son moved states away.  I framed it and the size is common so I did not need to spend a fortune.,5
"Great, readable and durable map. I mounted it on a wall to mark our travels it map tacks. I mounted it on a piece of luan, and framed it with small pictures of the places we'd visited. What a great way to remember people and places!",5
"nice large size, sturdy laminate, easy to write and highlight on with sharpie to mark your own route of adventure",5
Great quality map with lots of details. Also nice packing in the tube.,5
Very Detailed and lots of information.,5
"This map is exactly what I was looking for. It is big enough to be able to identify and mark individual countries and major cities, but does not take up he whole wall. It came rolled up and had no creases in it. I am glad I paid a little extra to get the laminated version. If you are looking for a classy map on which to mark your travels, I would look no further.",5
"I gave this to my Husband as a present for valentines day. I also purchased a cork roll and used a spray adhesive to stick the map on to the roll, then placed that in a frame that i got from Michaels at 50% off. This is a great travel map for using push pins.",5
"EXACTLY what I was looking for! I love all things travel, and I've been wanting a map to hang in my room for a few years now. It's taken me forever to find one as large as I would like that doesn't cost a fortune, or that isn't a decal that will have to be thrown out once you remove it from it's original placement. The colors are perfect, as they'll easily match a variety of room styles and I'll be able to continue using it even after I purchase new bedding/decor. It does come rolled up in a tube, so you'll want to lay it flat with heavy books or something on it in order to stop the map from curling back up or rolling.
I also love that I have the option to hang it however I want, rather than an option that comes framed. I'm planning to ""fake"" one of the wooden hanging systems by purchasing wooden dowels and then attaching one along the top and one along the bottom.",5
"I bought the 48x73 inch map for my husband. It arrived in great condition. It was not laminated, which is what I wanted. It will look amazing in the glass picture frame I am going to buy for it. The map looks just like the picture and is exactly as described.",5
good quality for the price.,5
This map is beautiful!  My kids can read it as well which is nice that it can still function as a map.,5
"Amazing map! Keeps trying to roll up after a day of being hung up but after a week it stayed still. Taped it onto styrofoam insulation and we are using it to keep track of our family travels. Really cool, detailed and educational. Lots of detailed extra information on map. Lots of labeled cities too.",5
Big and has everything we want on the map.,5
"Very large, detailed map - bought through Amazon (listed seller) and it arrived in perfect condition! Great idea to hang this on a wall where kids walk by it...they might happen to learn a thing or two from it! Couldn't hurt. This particular one is going to the UK for relatives. Hopefully give them a good idea how vast the US really is.",5
Great family travel map. We will be mounting and framing it. Bought some pins with it so each of us could mark our world travels. Think it's really well made,5
This is a nice map.  We wanted it to decide on a trip and it is working really well.  I like it.,5
"Excellent classroom map. Good clarity, durable lamination, not too ""busy/crowded""",5
nice,5
"It's a great map with lots of detail. The details get lost when looking at Alaska, but otherwise it looks very nice. The gloss finish is also nice, though it would be better if it were laminated. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good wall map of the lower 48. Alaska would really need its own map to do the state justice.",5
"Comes packaged in a tube, rolled up. Quality is great. Exactly what I was expecting. Is NOT laminated if that is what you are looking for.",5
Map is well made and the lamination is good quality.,5
"Bought to help decide where to move to.  This with some dry erase markers helped us figure out where we could NOT live (for whatever reason), where we'd PREFER not to live, where our family members are...I suppose it might be educational, too.",5
"This one went to our daughter and replaced some hideous unicorn poster. The map caused a lot of raised eyebrows, but now we are getting calls from her friends parents as it apparently sparked a fad... The world needs more fads like this (IMHO).",5
Perfect!,5
Great quality map with lots of details. Also nice packing in the tube.,5
Excellent gift for our teen son. Replaced the rock-band poster and caused a fad among his friends. My wife and I were completely surprised by the reaction!,5
Great thanks,5
As expected.,5
"We really like this map.  My daughter spent three months touring Europe with her best friend. After buying her one, she bought one for her friend. She's embellishing them with photos, tickets, receipts etc. for a great memory collage. Great size, colors, nice quality!",5
"This is a beautiful World Map that looks great on my wall. I love that it's laminated for protection. The color scheme gives it an old-world look, but the map boundaries and data are up-to-date. The size is perfect for being able to see from across the room.",5
I bought this so my son could learn all 50 states slowly by heart and every time he walks by them he likes to show off all the states he knows!!!,5
Exactly as advertized.,5
"Everyone who walks into my home comments on this map I have hanging on the wall. The colors are great and the size is great, makes quite a statement in addition to being easy to read and find things. I'm very happy with it.",5
beautiful map,5
"great product, and very happy with purchase. Item is perfect and as expected. thank you",5
Love it! Beautiful alternative to the typical world map. Looks great on our wall and we reference it often.,5
This came rolled in a poster tube exactly as described. I have put cork on the back and installed it in a frame to put push pins in and mark our travels.,5
Great map!  Using it to mark my travels.  Decorative and will look nice hanging in our home!,5
The map is very nice and I am pleased with it. The detail is good and easy to read with fairly decent roads and cities highlighted.,5
Item exactly how it was described and pictured.  Very elegant with subtle coloring.  It had a smooth finish.  It looked very nice framed.,5
My husband just moved to the US and this has really helped give him an idea of where different places are in the US. It also helps our 5 year old learn his states and to see where all our family is around the us. Nice quality.,5
"Looks great on the wall even unframed. Love the plastic coating to protect the map and reduce wrinkling. The aged look is very attractive, but easy to read.",5
"Although my original order was undeliverable due to damage, my contact with Amazon resulted in quick turnaround and the map arrived quickly.  The map itself is very nice although I agree with previous posts that lamination would be better but I knew what I was buying when I ""carted"" it.  The map is not as ""old"" looking as what it appears on my computer screen but is still a great item.",5
"I LIKE THE COLORS, SIZE, LETTERS. AMAZING ON WHAT A BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURE OF LAND WE OWN. PROUD TO AN AMERICAN...",5
"This was a large map, but not too large as I wanted to be able to read the cities and larger roads. I wrote on mine with a CD marker which worked well (regular markers were able to smear and wipe off if rubbed gently with a kleenix (or a shirt)). Excellant quality and thickness of lamination, and it came rolled up in a tube (so it had no damage to me in shipment) and when reverse rolled for a day or so it straightened out pretty well so I could work on it.",5
We wanted a map to pin locations we visited. This works fine mounted on a board. You can see enough detail to pin  locations.,5
"Love it! great map, great quality. definitely recommend this. don't have much else to say so .....america, america, america, america",5
just what we wanted,5
"This one went on the wall of our oldest kid. Had to put it up against his screaming ""objections,"" as he wanted either my vintage ""KISS"" poster or the map of Europe (that one went to his brother). Now they (our two sons) are playing a game of who can memorize more capitals (US states vs. EU states), bodies of water, bordering states etc. These games get pretty vicious sometimes, but hey... at least they both know the capital of Kentucky and can find Monte Carlo!",5
"Love the detail and quality of this poster map for the price. Honestly, it looks stunning when properly framed and hung up on a wall and should serve to inspire those who look upon it for many years.",5
Beautiful map sadly unable to use it due to it being too big for the space we hoped to put it in.,5
"EXACTLY what I was looking for! I love all things travel, and I've been wanting a map to hang in my room for a few years now. It's taken me forever to find one as large as I would like that doesn't cost a fortune, or that isn't a decal that will have to be thrown out once you remove it from it's original placement. The colors are perfect, as they'll easily match a variety of room styles and I'll be able to continue using it even after I purchase new bedding/decor. It does come rolled up in a tube, so you'll want to lay it flat with heavy books or something on it in order to stop the map from curling back up or rolling.
I also love that I have the option to hang it however I want, rather than an option that comes framed. I'm planning to ""fake"" one of the wooden hanging systems by purchasing wooden dowels and then attaching one along the top and one along the bottom.",5
"I bought the 48x73 inch map for my husband. It arrived in great condition. It was not laminated, which is what I wanted. It will look amazing in the glass picture frame I am going to buy for it. The map looks just like the picture and is exactly as described.",5
This map is beautiful!  My kids can read it as well which is nice that it can still function as a map.,5
"love that I could shop for a frame of my choice, because it fits a standard size.  looks great on the wall",5
"I love this map! It's really humongous. It basically takes up the entire wall in my room, but the print is a good quality and its very visually appealing. Everyone comments on it when they visit. I recommend! Adds a rustic sophisticated feel to your living quarters.",5
"We mounted this on cork board under my son's twin loft.  It is practically the perfect size, in height and width.  He LOVES it!  The antique color/look goes well with the colors of his room (tan/beige, navy, and olive green).  It is perfect for a boy's (of any age) room, office, etc.  Very professional and well done.  It arrived rolled inside a stiff plastic tube, and that was in a larger cardboard rectangle.  We are VERY satisfied and thrilled.",5
"The laminate work is tough, which I like. I am able to write/mark directly on the map using a dry erase marker, and it easily cleans off with a cloth. Being able to temporarily mark the map is helpful to me because I use this map to teach geography to my young daughters. For specificity, I use Expo brand dry erase markers.

The size is just as the item description indicates. Great product.",5
"Big map, easy to read.  Recommend for anyone needing to find their way.",5
"With much of the news being International, having a map behind you in your Home office makes things alittle smoother?  I mean, you hear of something, turn around and Walla?  you know where it is.  Very educational for all ages too...Well made and I like it.",5
This map is a gift from me to my husband.  He immediately hung it on his wall.  Now he marks the trips he has taken with one color pin and the trips on his bucket list with another color pin.  The map is laminated so finger prints easily wipe off it  and it looks very attractive in his office.,5
"I LOVE this map! Way more than I expected. I just bought it for reference and wanted something I could draw on and be able to remove the ink.

To my surprise there is the main map, then on the bottom left is the type of terrain map, and on the bottom right is the population map. This was so helpful for what I was using the map for!!

Not to mention I'm a college student and honestly, it looks pretty cool on my wall.",5
This map is used by my daughter who is teaching my grand daughter.  It is an excellent map.,5
"This map came fully laminated and ready to be hung on the wall.  All major thoroughfares are included as well.  It is perfect and I highly recommend it for home, office and school use.",5
PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS EXPECTED--AND ARRIVAL TIME WAS AS STATED IN THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE,5
"This fit a fancy, wide-framed cork board from Home Goods exactly.  1/4 inch border was pushed under each side of the frame, allowing another 1/4 in of white to show before the red border line.  All flags show.  The lamination will keep the map lasting for years, enabling map pins and flags to be inserted without tearing the map. My family includes many international lawyers and doctors, who work in Asia, Africa, and Europe providing humanitarian services.  One niece just moved to Singapore for business, while my sister lives currently in New Zealand.  We need lots of pins to track everyone's travels!",5
"Well made, colorful, strong laminate. I have loved maps of all kinds for a long time and I love this one......probably not an extremely helpful review but what the heck, I love maps :)",5
I'm using this map to track the breweries myself and my gf have gone to. I picked up a cheap frame and its going to work perfectly.,5
I bought this to pin up in my studio and tack all the places my artwork has been. It's just beautiful. Very well laminated - no bubbles. The place names are easy to read. Came quickly and shipped properly.,5
"I put this map up in the shower so I can learn a little geography in the morning. The laminate is great and makes the whole map waterproof! I definitely recommend putting this map up in your kitchen or bathroom where you will see it everyday, if only for a few minutes.

Another great feature of the map are the comments made in red text. Places with contested territory, like the Gaza Strip, have short descriptions about the current political situation and the outlook; so even if you're not up on the news, you will at least be aware that the area is subject to change soon.",5
"This laminated 30""x46"" National Geographic world map is really beautiful and the colors and size are perfect for the main wall in our home office in our Tuscan styled home.  I highly recommend it!  The price is less than on the maker's website, and it arrived in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime.  The map has a nice heavy lamination on front and back and it arrived in perfect condition, rolled, wrapped in a custom plastic sleeve, and shipped inside a very sturdy cardboard tube with packing material in the end of the tube.  We have unwrapped and rerolled it twice now, putting it back in the tube easily each time.  Now we want to have it framed with foamboard behind it and without glass, to use pushpins to show our travels. Our only question at this point relates to the custom framing, and we will follow up here when we see how that works out.  The framer (at Hobby Lobby) thinks it should be dry-mounted, since there will not be glass to hold the map flat, and they don't have mats large enough for it, but they expressed concern about the success of dry-mounting it because of the lamination.  We are trying to get advice/feedback from different sources regarding the framing, but if we do not get that, we expect to proceed with trying the dry-mounting since the map is so inexpensive , especially compared to the cost of framing it, and we could buy a replacement if the heat of the dry-mount process ruins the laminated map.  It appears the map is also available without lamination directly from National Geographic, so that is a possibility if we have to replace it, but I prefer buying through Amazon and love the price here.",5
"This is a fantastic map... really beautiful, nice quality, the laminate is thin so it doesn't feel overwhelming. Exactly what I would expect of a National Geographic product... we have it framed on top of cork-board and use it as a family travel map with pins. Great price and the project cost a fraction of what similar products (like in the Skymall magazines) sell for, but still looks very professional. Very happy with this purchase!",5
"Terrific map for the price. Looks great on the wall. We are in the travel business and need to refer to it all the time. As world events are constantly changing it is really a necessity. We chose to put it up with white thumbtacks so it hardly shows, framing was a too expensive way to go.

"Good value for the price. My wife is British, and we are in the travel business. Now she knows where Alabama is! We have clients from all over the US and the rest of the world. It comes in handy when you are looking for the nearest port for a cruise. Feel free to call us about the map or travel anytime.

"I really like this world map that we ordered from Amazon.  I ordered it so that my son could put stickers on it for science.  It came packaged in thick plastic, a cardboard tube, and a rectangular box, so it was very well packaged.  There were no scratches, folds, or other imperfections at all.  The map is very large, which is exactly what I was looking for.  It is well labeled, also.  Another thing I like about this map is it's neutral colors.  No hot pink countries here.  It is nicely laminated, so I am hoping eventually when we are done with the science stickers, they will come off.  If not, it wasn't very expensive, so I'd order another one.",5
Nice map of the moon.  Pretty large in size so to get a good view of it have it framed.  Other than that I have no complaints!,5
This was a gift.,5
Very nice book.  Bright and colorful and it gives a lot of details.  My children love sitting to look at the illustrations and learn about the microscope.,5
"I bought this for my daughter (7) to go along with her new microscope and slide set.  Although we haven't tried most of the suggestions, we did flip through it and it's a great book.  It gives enough detail to be valuable for years to come but not so much detail to be overwhelming to a child.  I would think this book will last her until at least age 12.  This is a great companion to a microscope gift!",5
Well written!,5
This book has alot of information and is worth the money. My daughter understands it and shes 8. It has different pictures with explanations and how to use the microscope.,5
I'm an ordained minister and instead of giving couples the usual bland marriage certificate I give them these instead.  Couples seem to enjoy these more and they look good.,5
I'm an ordained minister and instead of giving couples the usual bland marriage certificate I give them these instead.  Couples seem to enjoy these more and they look good.,5
They are lovely.,5
I am very happy with this product.,5
This is exactly what we needed for our small house church. We love the different categories (though we don't' use them all at this point) and the simplicity of design.,5
"Needed offering envelope for our small church.  My only wish was that the closing was like all the other envelopes for ease of use, but they are good.",5
just fine,5
Easy to use and a perfect size for purse or small area.  Plenty of space for all information.  I am vision impaired and can write large enough in it.,5
"Cath Kidson makes lovely, useful stationery items ... love, love, her designs!",5
"This is a great address book.  Good quality, attractive, and even though smaller than I expected, it had plenty of room for all kinds of information on each person I entered.",5
"I really like this, it's small, but there is still enough space for the information I need and also has a little section for keeping track of birthdays by month. Plus it looks adorable.",5
My favorite plan book ever. Lots of space to write and very versatile.,5
I like the sections and lines that are in this lesson plan book. I will buy again next year.,5
I have bought one of these every year for a long time.  You can use marker to create widths of columns wanted.  A Classic,5
"I am a middle school special ed teacher.  This planner works well for our 7 period day and afterschool meetings.  It has plenty of room for me to record the big concepts as well as notes about various students throughout the day,  The lines keep everything neat and the ability to create my own size columns is a plus too.  This will be my 2nd year using this lesson planner.",5
"I really love this. My son is almost 3 and this is a perfect learning tool for him. He is still too young to read or understand what all this means but knowing that when he is ready it will be here, is what matters most.
The wording I think is just right for a small child to understand and the colors are attractive. This is great for my son and I would recommend to others.",5
"Love this poster.  Made my Sunday School lesson easier because it was in easy-to-understand language,  Have several posters like this. Will continue to buy more.",5
Perfect for Kid's Playroom!,5
The kids loved the poster.  We spent a month on the Ten Commandments and thought that this poster would be a good reminder to leave up in the classroom.  Very colorful.,5
These little round stickers are charming. They talk about faith and God's love. They are unique because they are drawn by children and retain the childlike style. They are small stickers that I use to reward children when they say their Bible verses.,5
Buenisimo,5
Good for school supplies list. On time good quality and good price,5
USED THEM TO DECORATE ENVELOPES,5
Lovely details make it look like drawn by a kid. Perfect for faith formation or bible school.,5
"good product, exactly as described, the kids loved these in tots church",5
Cute little stickers. I give these to my class for little awards.,5
Bought these for gift Easter baskets and they were a big hit.  No issues.,5
cute,5
"These are wonderful for my daughter, Elion! She is 5 and I love making them for her. I also really liked the quality of the colors. Not too much cutting! Overall worth the price!",5
We used this book to make games for literacy night at school. It is worth the purchase.,5
"This book is one of the best reading comprehension skills book I've found.  I used general principles from Jim Treleases's Read Aloud Handbook (read aloud often and discuss everything) to improve my son's general reading comprehension, but I felt that he needed specific instruction on the types of questions he might encounter on standardized tests.

While I generally love Evan-Moor products, this book is better than their ""Read and Understand"" series and far superior to the Spectrum workbooks I've picked up.

This book presents reading comprehension as a game - my son becomes a ""Reading Detective"", looking for the specific clues in the readings that will provide the answer to higher level questions.  Kids are required to specify the sentences that provide the clues in addition to providing the answer.  I like how this gets my son engaged in meta-cognition, as he tries to  figure out how he knows what he knows.

Specifically, the book provides instruction and practice in drawing conclusions & making inferences;  defining vocabulary using context;  identifying story parts;  identifying the main idea and supporting details;  identifying the theme;  identifying cause and effect;  and making predictions.

I got my copy off of EBAY, but it is worth the full price.",5
Great!,5
This book is awesome and The passages are interesting and makes my students think. It teaches students to go back to the text and find the answer to the question. It is more rigorous than the other books I have.,5
"Excellent and fun exercises to motivate kids to read. I am constantly looking for ""interesting"" things for my 3rd graders to read.",5

"I really like this resource. I teach fourth-graders. This book helps the students learn to find specific information from a passage to support their thinking. It has several sections that focus on different skills: inference, main idea, cause and effect, etc.

Another good thing about this book is that it gives the reading level of each passage, ranging from levels 2-4. The passages are also interesting. Some are excerpts from well-known childrens' books.",5
"We all have GPS now-a-days, but there's no substitute for a highly detailed map book by Delorme.",5
"I've neen using this product for decades and find the current edition to be greartly improved.  It is more readable, the topography is better delineated, and more roads are actually named (but not all).  Well worth the price!",5
Nice atlas. I'd been waiting for this since they discontinued the stand along NH atlas. Nice features and details. Easy to read and use. I pulled the staples and cut out the pages (and cover) I didn't need to save space and fit it in a smaller location.,5
Definitely a comprehensive guide/info map.,5
Illuminating,5
Love these atlases.,5
Great,5
"A publication packed with useful information that is easy to understand. A must for any traveler heading to the last land frontier in the United States. Besides superior and information packed maps, the Alaska Atlas & Gazetteer provides readers with amazing insight into the culture, the settlement, the exploration and the little known facts that help readers develop an overall understanding of the state. The publication provides a remarkable insight into the Native-American population. Finally it provides pointers on where to go. I used this publication to plan my entire first visit. I love information on paper. The maps alone are worth hundreds of dollars.",5
"A nice addition to my going on vacation Gazetteer's, used this on this years cruse to Alaska lots of useful info,",5
"not a lot to say, it is a Topographic atlas of alaska. i am ""old school"" and like paper so i plan on using it with a hand held GPS for a camping trip.",5
"We are military and buy the gazeteer for every state we live in, hunt or fish in.  This one is huge!!! And it is still the same price.  It is so thorough and we have loved every gazeteer we have ever bought, so worth the money.  We did buy the Milepost (on pre-order) as well since we are doing the trek up north to move to Alaska but I do not see how it could compare to the awesome Gazeteers!",5
Probably one of the best books on Perspective we received it on time,5
Grandson reads all of the time without doing anything else this will let him know that he read long enough its time for other stuff to be done,5
Exactly as advertised.  Arrived on time.  It is what it is.,5
Awesome product,5
So far its great. I set it up for my daughter. It's to hard for her to do it herself.,5
Love it! Works perfectly and my daughter uses it for her school reading logs.,5
Great stocking-stuffers!,5
"Works great, no more ""mom am I done with my 15 min?"". She sets the timer and it goes off when her time is up. Great invention.",5
fast-shipping,5
Fun tool for reading !,5
Perfect gift for any age group,5
Awesome gift for any age group,5
"I love these timers! I have 3 of them. It helps my kids to keep track of their reading minutes. They don't cut their time short, and they love having it to check their time. My kids are 14, 12 and 7 who are using the timers, so it's perfect for all ages. I actually recommend these to people all the time! Great for grandparents to give as gifts. Love Love Love!",5
"Easy to use, daughter loves it.",5
Great for kids to keep track of how long they have been reading. Bought one for all my children.,5
Stocking stuffer,5
this is an awesome tool for young readers!,5
These are great for keeping track of reading time.  Kids love them.,5
High quality item.  I liked it but don't get it for a 13-year-old.  I thought she could use it for timing her French horn practice sessions or how long she's reading or doing homework.  She didn't see it that way and I haven't seen this since Christmas.  So.  I think good for a younger child but I messed up on getting it for her.  The packaging also refers to younger children which didn't help.,5
Got this for my daughter so she could time how long she's read. It works great. Can use it for a clock timer and even a stop watch great product for a kid or even adult who loves to read!,5
"I bought this from Barnes and Noble. It lasted about a month and now the option where you count up minutes won't reset anymore. The other option still resets so the buttons for resetting still work. Very disappointing. It has only been used once a day and has not been dropped or damaged to stop working like that. I was expecting this to last us much more than one month.

Update: I was able to fix the problem by removing the battery and then inserting it again. But still, this shouldn't have issues so soon with so little use of only once per day.

Update ( a bunch of time later) We haven't had any more problems. Now the only problem with this timer is that it likes to hide. But when we do find it, it works great. :)",5
My daughter has had this product for 10 months now.  She uses it daily for her homework and used it very regularly over the summer as well.  Does a very nice job.  Haven't yet had to replace the battery.  And it helps her be more independent with her homework.  Pleased with the product.,5
"This CD set by Harry and Rosemary Wong is great for the veteran teacher as well as the teacher fresh out of college. The ideas are so simple yet they are so complexed in their delivery and results. Coupled with the classic ""The First Days of School"", this CD is worth the money and then some. The main idea: You will be effective and sucessful if you develop procedures for your classroom. Tell the students what you want them to do and then model for them how to do it. Ordering this CD allows you to listen to the lecture anytime anywhere:at home, in your car, at work. I highly recommend this for any teacher regardless of years of experience.",5
"These CD's have excellent applied examples that accompanies the Wong's book I...The
First Day of School. Great for new and established teachers. The only down side, wish it had viedo to go with audio. Give many great ideas to help teachers with clalssroom management, assessments, lesson plans. Order came before due date in excellent condition.",5
Daughter needed for AP college level chem and it is perfect for her.  Seems to be holding up after daily stuffing a book bag and locker for the last 9 weeks.,5
Well constructed and efficient,5
"Very durable, plenty of pages, and unlike other lab notebooks it is spiral bound, which I like. Probably a fair bit cheaper than your college bookstore, too.",5
I use this every week for my chemistry notes and labs.  So far it is awesome!!  I love that it makes copies of my notes.  This has allowed me to turn in notes and still have them.  It also allows me to share with friends who are out that day!!  I would not be doing so good in my chem class without it!!,5
"I used every single page in this lab notebook over the course of 3 semesters of Chemistry lab. TERRIFIC lab notebook. I love the spiraled notebook compared to the bound kind. It is easier to flip and you can lay it flat to write in. This is also a great, great price. I bought the bound kind for $40 in my campus bookstore and this was $10. You won't find a better deal. The carbon copy also works great. I had to turn in the carbon copy after each lab for 1.5 years and never had any problems. Would highly recommend if you need a lab notebook that carbon copies (this is when you write on a page and it makes a copy onto the next page so you can keep a copy and tear out the other copy to turn in to your professor). If you don't need this, don't buy this...just get a regular notebook.

This is also a chemistry lab notebook and will have a periodic table (very helpful). I had one for biology before, so look for one of those if you're using this for biology. Only con is that there is a pocket in the front page that can't fit regular-sized copy paper. I had to fold papers in half if I wanted to put anything there. Not a big deal though.",5
"This was a great buy. I must say, I really didn't want to buy one, but my chemistry professor insisted that we did...whatever. Seriously though, I'm glad I did, it kept all of my lab reports neat, and I didn't have to worry about anything. I did find it irritating sometimes when I forgot to put the plastic divider behind the page I was working on, because then my markings would go through 2-3 sheets, but that was my own fault.

The book itself had 100 pages, all numbered. The ring binding is strong and not the flimsy wire type. It has a contents page where you can transcribe your title and page numbers, but best of all, the covers are packed full of useful information that can be used as a quick reference if for example you find yourself needing to quickly find conversion factors, metric prefixes/notations, commonly used physical constants and equations, or values from the periodic table.

For people who struggle with organization, this will be super useful for you. For people who are super type-A, this will be super useful to you. It works for everyone.",5
We got this product for my son's lab class.,5
"Best product for the price, no problems and always leaves a good legible copy.",5
School required so it is as expected.,5
Like this notebook. Especially in the first page it has a few useful data for several organic chemicals. also good quality.,5
Great product. Perfect for any chemistry course. High School- College and past that. Perfect size and tons of great chemistry related information included as well. Absolutely perfect.,5
"Praise this note book. Better then the ones that need to switch the carbon copy, Warning it can sink about a couple pages in.",5
"I first ordered one for each of my boys currently in high school science classes, but after seeing the tables and information in the books, sent for a third one just to keep on-hand in case one got lost.  Both boys are acing their classes, and I know this book has helped.",5
"I haven't used it yet, but I can tell that this is the nicest lab notebook on the market.  As someone else mentioned, the only small fault with this notebook is that the copy page is the same color as the original page.  That aside, the construction and feel of this lab notebook is unrivaled.",5
these are great tabs.  they are much more sturdy than the other bible tabs available.  can you guys make some tabs for our bible study?,5
Great  product,5
"The tabs are not for my version but I managed to find their spots quickly. It really makes the CCC come alive. For folks like me who are not as well versed as others, it makes the book less daughnting. Looking up answers to daily questions is a cinch now.",5
Great,5
"Excellent, Thank You.",5
Excellent for anyone who will like to know better the faith. Very handy to find what you are looking for in the subject of study.,5
Put to the use.,5
"If you purchase a Catholic Catechism, you have to get these tabs!!! There are tabs for each of the major sections, so you can navigate the book with ease. You will be the envy of all your friends when they see you quickly opening your Catechism to a section while they fumble through it hoping to find the table of contents to find the section and pages they are looking for. (If you know someone who has a catechism, these tabs make an awesome gift.) I do alot of bible studies and I need to be able to access my support materials and info quickly. These tabs really help me find things fast! The one piece of advice I must give anyone who purchases the Catechism tabs, or Bible tabs, is DO NOT just start sticking the tabs on the pages. If you do, you may end up with a messed up tabbing system. You want to be sure to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY. If you do that and use the tab line up template guide that is provided, your tabs will be perfect. Even if it seems weird to start from the back of the book or whatever it tells you to do, just go with it. It will work perfectly. (It's an exercise in faith! ha ha) Once your tabs are in your Catechism will be accessible and your searching time will be greatly reduced!",5
Perfect for helping navigate through the book,5
"Just what I wanted, and just as described.",5
"Love these. Makes it easy to find topics in the Catechism.  Though the instructions did not match perfectly, it was easy to get the correct page number on my own.  I plan to get another set to match with my US Adult version.",5
Helps find things quickly. Looks nice too.,5
Perfect for my bible,5
"AWESOME! A MUST HAVE! MAKES UNDERSTANDING AND STUDY EASIER! These tabs are almost IMPOSSIBLE to find elsewhere. These are excellent! Sturdy and well made! Breaking down the Catechism like this makes it much easier to find topics, study topics and not so intimidating. I HIGHLY recommend them for new comers to the Catholic faith and anyone trying to read and understand the Catechism! MANY MANY THANKS!!!",5
"These tabs are 'made for' the USCCB edition of the Catechism - unfortunately (and oddly - as other USCCB publications are) not available through Amazon (but which can be found at any Catholic bookstore - brick and mortar or online). They work very well and allow for quick access to the various sections of the Catechism. I give it five stars because the index tabs are of high quality, very simple to apply and a great reference source.",5
"These calendars are just beautiful! The pictures could be framed after using the calendar! I bought 3! One for me and 2 others for Christmas gifts and they loved them! So much information in the back about Jewish celebrations and Holy days, festivals, etc. Would definitely recommend!",5
Extra nice and well made calendar! Would highly recommend to others!,5
"And what did I want?  I'm an American (so I wanted those holidays), a believer in Yeshua as Messiah (so I need those related holidays - paganized and otherwise), I'm Torah observant (at least I try, so I need those Biblical holidays as well as the monthly Hebrew calendar dates), and I love the Land of Israel and have been a many times visitor (so I recognize and greatly enjoy the great photographic artwork).  This calendar is perfect for what I need and want.  BTW, it arrived noticeably wrinkled - Amazon needs to provide more shipping protection.",5
"These have been my favorite,  and only,  calendars since I discovered them.  All around perfect for all my calendaring needs.",5
"A very cool wall calendar. I appreciate that they try to show diversity among the scientists they feature. They show women and people of color frequently throughout the months. There's lots to look at and read, including many fun facts. It also features important historical events in space science as well as important events for sky-watching. I'll definitely save it after the year is through.",5
Great product & fast service,5
Wonderful calendar with lots of info about space. Great gift for the kids and grandkids!,5
These calendars are my favorite. I didn't get one for Christmas this year SO I had to order one for myself. Can't live without them. They bring happiness and color to my life.,5
Cool calendar! Bought for teenage son.,5
"love lang calendars - they are a neat piece of art in the room, frequently inspirational and make lovely gifts",5
"Have been buying these for several years. Calendar images are high resolution, great color and the space event information is very thorough.",5
I have been buying these calendars for many years.  They never disappoint.  Quality photographs and serious information keep me informed of upcoming events and historical dates.  Highly recommend these for personal use and gifts.,5
Very happy prints on each page.  Makes me smile to look at it.  Nice heavy weight pages.  I use an ultrafine sharpie to write on the pages as they are coated.,5
This stuff is AWESOME! I like to put it on right out of the shower .. it leaves skin so soft! I use it on my face to .. doesn't clog pores!,5
Love these for bridal party. Very natural looking. ,5
It leaves my hair soft,5
i tied this just once so im not sure how good it is but i did notice it does make my skin softer,5
"I love this stuff. It is amazing. I have used it for my hair, skin, and nails. It makes my skin super soft without feeling greasy. I actually used this to shave my legs in the shower and it worked well. I use it on my hair and my hair is very soft. I use it on my face (just 1 drop) and it adds enough moisture without going over to the greasy side. I actually tend to get oily skin but, this really helps keep that in control. My skin looks matte after is absorbs and stays that way for awhile. Lasts all day on face and body. There is no scent, so it doesn't bother any allergies either.",5
"InstaNatural Jojoba Oil is a multipurpose oil for so many different things. I have used it in my hair, on my nails, and on my skin. It makes my hair look and feel healthy. It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. It helps moisturize my cracked cuticles. This jojoba oil is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave a greasy feeling behind. I tried this oil on my face as a moisturizer. It was okay but I have sensitive skin that is acne prone and I did develop some breakouts due to it. My favorite use for this oil is on my legs though. After shaving my legs are always SO dry and feel like alligator skin. I put a few drops of this in my lotion or even by itself and it brings my legs back to life. They look and feel so much healthier thanks to this oil. They are no longer itchy and don't have irritation. This oil is definitely a keeper for me! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*",5
"Jojoba oil is one of my favorite moisurizers becasue it is long lasting and isn't too greasy for me. This is no exception, I continue to be pleased with Insta Natural products.",5
Smells great,5
"I have very thick, coarse, curly hair. I have tried every product under the sun to keep the frizz at bay. I really like this jojoba oil. I have used Argan oil for months; I switched to give the jojoba oil a try. It works just as well, if not better. When I first get out of the shower I put a dropper full  around my head, close the scalp, and around the ends. I comb it through and style as usual. It definitely keeps my curls more defined and keeps the frizz away. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product in my home. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Great for curls.",5
These were great. I did not have to cut them or do anything. I just stuck the on.....I did buy some eyelash glue just in case but did not need them. I put mine back in the box and will use again....,5
"Sister needed something to write on, brought this book for her. It works wonderfully for her.",5
I find everyone likes to hear 'Thank You' when they help or do something for you. Storing up on as many interesting and well designed Thank You cards is important for me. I was happily surprised to see that these were well made and include an embossed lettering that makes it stand out. They are made with heavier card stock and well made envelopes. I hope they design additional interesting thank you notes in the future.,5
"These cards are made of quality stock. The design is a matter of personal preference, of course, but the printing job is quite professional.",5
Loved the product.  Thanks for the quick shipping.,5
good,5
"Classy, clean and simple design",5
"Excellent and professional looking cards. I really like that you have many styles for the mood or intentions of the card. So, for me, it was important
to find a Thank You card that represented me. And i found it!
So keep on making different styles! Thanks!!",5
"The straightforward, understated thank you notes. The heavy card stock, look great, and appropriate for most informal thank yous. Highly recommend.",5
"Just what they say they are. Pretty, and simple. Nice cardstock, clean printing. The only thing I would change is the logo on the back of each card.",5
"I always want the kids to write thanks you cards for the gifts that they get, but I never have any thank you cards around. Do when I was offered this pack of Thank You Cards from pretty.simple.cards. for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered them! They arrived and I am very impressed with them! They are super simple with no crazy design that could possibly limit who I could send them to. I definitely recommend these Thank You Cards from pretty.simple.cards for anyone who needs great thank you cards!",5
"I write fifteen to twenty thank you cards a week to my staff at work thanking them for various things so I was super excited when I was given the opportunity to purchase these at a special price to test for quality and give my honest opinion of them.  These cards are top of the line made of heavy linen cardstock.  The ""Thank You"" is raised block lettering.  The inside of the card is blank so you can use them for anything.

They are nice enough to use to send as a thank you for wedding gifts, birthday gifts or to just make someone feel special.  Every staff member I have given one to have commented about the quality of this card.  Best of all, the envelopes don't have to be licked to seal (I hate that!).  They have a peel strip to seal the cards.  The set comes in a great clear acetate re-closable box to keep your cards organized in your desk drawer.

With the art of writing thank you cards going to the wayside, being replaced to text messages and e-mails, make someone's day and send them this high quality thank you card.",5

"I love these Big Bold Thank You cards! I like that the Thank You really stands out! This company makes an excellent quality product. I was very impressed with the high grade of cardstock used to make these cards and the envelopes were quality made as well, they had a peel off tab to seal them shut. A quality I always look for when buying cards, it seems so old-fashioned, not to mention unsanitary to lick an envelope shut! I am very please with the quality of these cards and will definitely put them to good use. Never underestimate the power of a thoughtful, well written & hand written Thank You note. It's an extra added touch that shows you took the time out to write the card, therefore, you really care.
Please note that I did receive these Thank You cards at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, I couldn't be happier, they are a quality card and I would absolutely recommend them. Excellent product!",5
"I ordered these thank you notes for a friend who is getting married.  They are simple yet elegant and expensive looking.  They are made with a heavier card stock than most thank you cards you buy at a local store.  Each card has a nice textured black bold print on the front.  The cards are a good size 3 1/2  X 5"".  The envelopes have a easy peel strip to seal.  My friend will love them.  There are so many people to thank and these will come in handy.  There is plenty of space inside for her personal note too. These are very nice.  I definitely recommend.  I did receive this product at a discount to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.",5
"These are simple yet elegant Thank You Cards. I am always writing thank you notes for friends, family and business associates. When I was offered these simple thank you cards at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review, I was happy to do just that. These cards arrived on time and in a nice clear, solid package. There were 12 Thank You cards, blank inside, made out of a premium grade linen cardstock. These are definitely not your average Thank You cards.

In fact, there was a Thank You note included with these cards thanking me for my purchase and a coupon code to use at the website for an 18% discount and free shipping on my future purchase. Now that is something I can appreciate. A very thoughtful gesture.",5
"The seller's name above really does a perfect job describing these - pretty and simple. I try to keep Thank You cards around our house. There are six of us so that is a lot of birthdays that require thank you notes, not counting all of the other occasions (Christmas, anniversary, Easter, etc...). I am also always on the lookout for Thank You cards that are different from the ones you can buy around here. I live in a small town and we are limited on items like this. I like for mine to be different than what everyone else in town has.

These Thank You Cards from pretty.simple.cards are blank folder over note cards. They are 3 1/2 inches by 5 inches cards when folded over and 7 inches by 5 inches when unfolded. On the front of the card is a simple ""Thank You"" in the lower right corner and inside they are blank. Being blank on the inside leaves you the entire card to write a message. The cards come in a plastic holder so that you don't have to worry about the cards being loose and getting messed up. The cards are made from card stock paper that has a slight texture. The back flap of the envelope might seem odd to mention here but there are two things about this flap I wanted to point out. First, the flat is not the typical triangle/pointed design but more of a rounded rectangle. I think this gives the card a more expensive look. Second, the flap is self sticking! You peel off the strip and stick it down. This is a wonderful feature to add to these cards! These are quality cards and have the look of expensive, boutique cards.

These came just in time because we have a birthday party soon and will need them! I don't think you can ever have too many Thank You cards around!

I received these at a special promotional price in exchange for my evaluation and an honest, unbiased review.",5
"These Thank You Cards from pretty. simple. cards. are just lovely! They are printed on high-quality card stock, and look very expensive. The self-sealing envelopes are a very nice touch, I love them! No more licking envelopes!

These cards are very classy, and would be perfect for any classy occasion (showers, weddings, etc..) or to just have on hand when you want to drop someone a thank you note.  They would be especially handy for teachers to have on hand when their students bring them gifts during the holidays or end of the school year.

I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.",5
"These Thank You Cards from pretty. simple. cards. are simply beautiful. ""Thank you"" is printed in a beautiful script font on the cover of the card. So elegant!  The self-sealing envelopes are a very nice touch, I love them! No more licking envelopes!

"Beautiful journal, from the cover to the pages. Hopefully I can fill it with something other than whining. ;-)",5
Great journal to use. I love the thick texture and the way it absorbs the ink.  It has a great leather cover and looks like it will last a very long time.,5
Stunning!,5
"I have been journaling for over 35 years.  I have many chapters of my life in all kinds of styles of books; leather, pleather, cloth-covered...you name it.  Having survived a particularly long and adverse illness, I now find a new appreciation of my life as a result of unexpected survival.  This calls for some serious journaling and my husband found THE perfect vessel in which to write my story - this magnificent leather record; rich, fragrant leather bursting with the most luxurious almost cloth-like paper that absorbs my fountain pen thoughts like butter on a hot biscuit. I truly believe you will LOVE it as much as I do.  I highly recommend this journal, and may need a second one before I am done!",5
"I really like this journal--it's large but portable, offering an excellent writing experience. The paper is cloth and good quality with strong bindings for the gatherings, and the leather is nifty.",5
"Great product. My daughter loved it. This was what she was looking and wanting for, she uses it as a travel art journal. She use different kinds of media on them, watercolor, PITT pens, charcoal, markers etc and she didn't have any problem as to bleeding issues, so far.",5
Very nice.  Will hold a lot of writing.  Has an adventurers look.  Plan to buy more for gifts.,5
"This is awesome!!! Could not ask for better. With the best price I've seen so far.  The leather is perfect. Just can't tell you how great it feels to receive exactly what I was looking for in the mail. Words fail. If you're looking for a compact,high quality,take anywhere, last forever,Journal, you have to get this.",5
"Very well made, attractive, around 200 pages, and fun to write in. Not the best option if you use primarily fountain pens. Some nibs don't like the texture of the cotton paper.",5
This thing is really cool! We got this for a wedding present so that the new couple could keep a journal if their lives together and it really looks cool and feels good int he hand. The pages are blank and bound in 4 or 5 leaflets if memory serves. I am going to be getting one for my self as well.,5
"At first i worried if the strap can keep the cover tightly around the notebook, but it's certainly not a problem cause the friction is good enough to hold it. The size is small and pages are thick as I wanted. The pages are really nice that i can use fountain pens and write with forces and the ink won't go to the other side. The only explains i got beside the price is that there are five bundles of papers and it makes it a bit hard to write due to the height of it above your desk. But anyway, the thickness is one charm of it, so you just need to deal with it.",5
VERY GOOD QUALITY!,5
"I am certainly pleased with this journal. I as of late been fascinated with leather rustic looking journals, and this one is on top of my love it list. Fine leather and the pages make the package complete. I would imagine this would be very suitable for LARP and Renaissance fair use.",5
excellent product,5
I absolutely love this and it has become an indispensable tool for growing my business and making my days easier by helping me focus on what is most important. It pairs very well with the Productivity app to stay on task and take breaks. I already bought one for my girlfriend and I plan to get more as gifts.,5
Makes a nice gift!,5
"This is the best planner I've ever used - several of us in our office have ""drunk the Kool Aid"" and are passionate about our planners. It has really helped me get through items on my to do list that I always put off - when you have to constantly write them down it really does motivate you to just take care of that stupid task! I'm going to add a self adhesive 3M pocket to the inside cover of my next one to keep little notes in, and I use flags to bookmark certain pages for reference (adding a couple ""notes"" pages in the very back or front would be helpful for ideas that need time to marinate (sometimes until the next planner)).

I don't know what the cover is made from, but it feels sooooo good in your hands, if that doesn't sound weird? It makes you want to carry it around and open it up and tell it all your aspirations...",5
"Great planner option for someone with a busy lifestyle and finds themselves unable to compelete all designated tasks throughout the week.

The planner is a hard cover book (which is good for durability) and has pages filled with questionaires and different sections to help better completing your tasks for the day or week.

Even if you are a well organized person who can get through their rough days it doesn't hurt to have a documentation of your hard work. I highly see the layout of the planner being able to apply to different areas of your life!",5
"Perfect for me. Simple. One goal a day at its core, supplemented by second tier goals. Grows on you. Thgrows just enough theory of getting your priorities right to get the ball rolling. No endless videos to watch or stuff to read, no superlative-laced platitudes on the greatest achievement ever, every day..
Just the one single goal. Do it. Done.",5
"On day three, but love it so far.  Very clean and simple, but effective.  Sticking to the pomederos has been helpful to me.  Love the clean layout.",5
would get again,5
"Small enough to fit in a purse, but big enough to write your daily plan/activities in.  Like it very much!",5
Innovative product. Very pleased and recommend.,5
"Just started using it, very helpful. I love having a much shorter list!!!!",5
"love everything about it, wish  they had a seven day week planner though.
I wish this company had more products, like a simple planner.",5
This stupid little journal helps me keep my life together. Woot!,5
"This coloring book, created for adults or very patient teenagers, is one of the nicest I've seen. I currently have a nice set of various coloring books but this one by Sarah Taylor is just beautifully done. Whimsical patterns and shapes come together inside animal bodies to create an enjoyable experience that also results is really artistic and great looking images when finished. I prefer to use colored pencils, but very thin markers would also look good if you want very saturated colors. The pages are thick paper so thin markers won't bleed through. I do prefer the subtle shading effects of colored pencils but since this is art, there are really no rules.

I love these types of books to relax and get away from the craziness of modern life. I do think there is a sort of zen quality which is hard to explain, and you get a lot of time to think when working on these animal pictures. Or maybe you prefer to listen to a podcast or music. Either way, you can't go wrong with adult coloring books and this one in general. They make a great unique gift for the person who has everything. This one is great for animal lovers, but there are so many different styles from random patterns to architecture to nature things and even famous actors and musicians. Adult coloring books seem to really be catching on the last few years and I can't see any downside to that. Sometimes it's a good thing to get back to basics.",5
"This is a really nice adult coloring book.  The drawings have enough detail to make me happy, but the lines are thick enough so I don't go crazy.  I color with Copic markers so I always want a book with thick paper and bold graphics.  This works well.  However, the images are printed on both sides of the page and the markers do bleed through.  With coloring pencils you should have no problems.  I also do not really care for the activity pages such as ""complete the maze"", ""seek and find these objects"" and  ""draw a hat on this creature"".  That's not what I color for.  There are a few pages like that in the book, but still enough strictly coloring pages to keep me occupied.",5
"usually ""adult coloring book"" makes me think of a coloring book full of pornography that I get to color! which I would also buy in a minute.
This coloring book? wow, could it not have been more perfectly made for me! I am obsessed with owls, rabbits, birds, nature and these illustrations are amazing, beautiful, stunning, difficult! I cannot wait to use all my pens, gel..watercolor, pencils, etc in this. I sometimes have to wait at a coffee shop for my loves to get me and this is just the kind of mind stimulation I need (besides coffee)",5
"More people need to know about this coloring book. Especially those who love coloring pages filled with animals/nature.

I own Derwent Inktense Watercolor  pencils- awesome pencils that go on like a colored pencil but you then wet lightly for a really intense effect!
( YOU CAN USE *DERWENT INKTENSE WATERCOLOR PENCILS* DRY FOR THIS COLORING BOOK.

 I DON'T ADVISE USING THEM WITH WATER, BECAUSE THE COLORING BOOK PAGES ARE NOT MADE OF WATER COLOR PAPER AND THE TIGHTER AREAS THAT YOU COLOR IN? IF YOU ADD WATER TO INKTENSE, IT WILL SPREAD OUT OF THE LINES)

However, for the purposes of this book, a good quality colored pencil set  with nice pigment and color selection or a varied set of gel pens would work fine here. NOTE: Gel pens are different from magic markers/markers. Markers will bleed.",5
".

This is a beautiful book for some great illustrations from the natural world to color at your leisure and using your own imagination. This is a very creative and relaxing way to rid yourself of the stresses and strains of a busy day. On first inspection we felt it was too beautiful to spoil such a lovely, detailed and well-designed book. This coloring book can be appreciated by all ages to share. This book has quality written all over it, the binding is tight and firm. The quality of the paper is good, and as the guide lines suggest you only use dry drawing media such as coloring pencils. There are also supportive tips and methods on how to use coloring pencils, by layering and blending color so you can get the most out of your coloring book. This then means you should not have any bleed through of colour. Please don't be misled - by the books' size, the involved detailing will require that any half interested user will be kept absorbed for hours, as there is plenty to do. This is very much a cross-generational coloring book that should keep all ages happily occupied. Over all the Flora and Fauna theme is done rather well.

Considering what you are getting in this beautiful book, the pricing - in my humble opinion is fair. My family and I will certainly be getting more of these books in the range, both for our coloring-in pleasure as well as sending them out as presents, over the festive season.

"This is a lovely adult nature scene coloring book from Derwnet. The book come with a bonus pack of 10 colored pencils. The book is filled with printed pages of wildlife scenes, and has a few pages of ""draw your own"", which I have never seen before. The book is a nice heavy weight paper made for colored pencils, but not made for markers. This would make a great gift pack for anyone who loves adult coloring books.",5
"Quality color pencils AND a nice adult coloring book for under $10? Can't beat that. Colors are bright and vivid and the book has at least a couple hours of coloring time in there. I personally prefer the more celtic style artwork, but these the images here are well illustrated with plenty of detail to keep you busy.",5
"This is an awesome coloring book. It's thicker than I expected, and the illustrations are intricate yet somehow rhythmic, if that makes sense. They're perfect for winding down or de-stressing. The colored pencils are high-quality (Derwent Colorsofts, in fact) and they provide vibrant color and layering capabilities. Definitely recommended.",5
"Love this coloring book and the pencils provided. I own just about any collection of colored pencils, from Faber Castell, to Carandache and Inktense to Luminance. After trying the Derwent colored pencils I am hooked again to buy the full set of these as well. They lay so nicely in my hand and there is something special about them. Every good quality pencil has a different feel and slightly different color/hue imo. The coloring book has a southwestern feel about it and the equity of the paper is superb. It comes with some fine introduction into layering, blending etc.which is useful for new colorists. A very nice book to get you started in the coloring book craze; to see if it might be a new hobby for you. Highly recommended!!!",5
Nice designs to immerse in to color.,5
"Love this book, need more colors.",5
GREAT PRODUCT - WELL MADE,5
Excellent delivery. Been wanting a classy passwords journal. Can't wait to get started,5
works very good with all my passcodes,5
Great for office.,5
Excellent product,5
Has everything i was looking for. Only improvement i would add is tabs to find the sections. Very attractive little book.,5
"This little book is perfect and fits right in your purse.  The magnetic closure is very strong. There's enough space to write notes when needed and it's easy to write in. The pages don't feel cheap like the recycled papers you buy for school.  There was no bad smell for me. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have one of those little pockets on the inside. Even though this is a password journal, it'd still be nice to have a pocket on one or both ends of the book for those who will be using this and carrying it with them all the time.  The bonded leather and the stitching are nice.  The book lays flat for when your writing in the book, which is very good for me.

Pros for this product:
1.  Bonded leather and sticking
2.  Lays almost all the way flat when writing

Chins for this product :
1.  No pockets at either end of the book",5
cute as gifts,5
"These pocket pal journals are a big hit for my friends who want to keep daily gratitude journals in their purses.  They have motivational messages on the front, they are small enough to be tucked virtually anywhere and they have a space on the front cover for a name, etc. if someone misplaces one and wants it returned.  I only wish it were college ruled vs. regular ruling but, hey for the price these are great little giveaways!  Highly recommend.",5
"My son goes through pocket journals like mad! He loves to draw on them.  These are lined, but still work well for drawing in the car, church, etc.",5
Such a cute set of small notebooks!  These are small enough to carry with you to jot down notes or whatever.  A great find!,5
Just what I needed.,5
"I love love love these mini journals! They are well constructed, attractive to look at, have very thin rules, (which makes up for smaller page number), and fit perfectly in my Henry Green Leather passport wallet, which doubles as my everyday journal wallet when I'm not traveling abroad!
