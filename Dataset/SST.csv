",1
2,"they presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
",1
3,"the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
",2
4,"this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce .
",3
5,"um , no. .

6,"jonathan parker 's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .

7,"campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful .
",3
8,"a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
",1
9,"b챕art and berling are both superb , while huppert ... is magnificent .
",4
10,"a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
",1
11,"the film is strictly routine .
",1
12,"a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world .
",3
13,"the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff챕 and demi moore 's the scarlet letter .
",1
14,"for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -lrb- sci-fi -rrb- rehash .
",1
15,"this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force .
",4
16,"may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done .
",3
17,"there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .

19,"as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr. lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .
",4
20,"final verdict : you 've seen it all before .

21,"blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
",1
22,"you ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
",1
23,"a slick , engrossing melodrama .
",4
24,"a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man 's quest to find an old flame .
",1
25,"eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .
",2
26,"will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
",1
27,"one of -lrb- jaglom 's -rrb- better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love .
",2
28,"lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience .
",0
29,"the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .
",3
30,"the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once ... a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller .
",4
31,"too bad .
",1
32,"a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man .
",4
33,"gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .
",1
34,"you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .
",2
35,"a well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
",1
36,"analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film 's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
",2
37,"there 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .
",2
38,"a fun ride .
",3
39,"what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song .
",2
40,"an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .
",3
41,"` what 's the russian word for wow !? '
",3
42,"you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible .
",2
43,"many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short .
",2
44,"otto-sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye .
",3
45,"lurid and less than lucid work .
",1
46,"a portrait of an artist .
",2
47,"once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .
",2
48,"with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .
",2
49,"many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , -lrb- yet -rrb- are worthwhile .

50,"with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
",1
51,"i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .
",1
52,"overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone .
",4
53,"you live the mood rather than savour the story .
",3
54,"the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
",3
55,"here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably .
",2
56,"some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
",3
57,"it 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
",3
58,"while american adobo has its heart -lrb- and its palate -rrb- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .
",1
59,"unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck .
",4
60,"and it 's a lousy one at that .
",0
61,"it 's not too fast and not too slow .
",3
62,"it 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space .
",3
63,"it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .
",3
64,"compellingly watchable .
",4
65,"despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire .
",1
66,"he may have meant the internet short saving ryan 's privates .
",2
67,"though jackson does n't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees .
",3
68,"not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again .
",4
69,"it 's worth taking the kids to .

70,"the movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .

",0
74,"poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures .
",3
75,"a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .
",2
76,"methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain .
",4
77,"this is amusing for about three minutes .
",2
78,"though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .
",3
79,"superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
",4
80,"a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity .
",3
81,"it 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can .
",3
82,"the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting .
",3
83,"admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form .
",4
84,"not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
",1
85,"an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .
",0
86,"becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .
",0
87,"at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .
",2
88,"could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ?
",4
89,"this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .
",3
90,"more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
",1
91,"cho 's timing is priceless .
",4
92,"criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama .
",3
93,"there 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .
",3
94,"what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish .
",4
95,"greengrass -lrb- working from don mullan 's script -rrb- forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .
",2
96,"nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful .
",4
97,"the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .
",3
98,"it 's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
",1
99,"jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
",1
100,"jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting .
",2
101,"... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .
",1
102,"over and over again .
",1
103,"nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .
",4
104,"this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .
",1
105,"... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .
",1
106,"the drama discloses almost nothing .
",1
107,"a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .
",1
108,"isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries .
",4
109,"but ` why ? '
",2
110,"like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest .
",3
111,"perhaps the best sports movie i 've ever seen .
",4
112,"this pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
",0
113,"ou 've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane .
",3
114,"this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life .
",4
115,"playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity ... bisset is both convincing and radiant .
",3
116,"the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .
",1
117,"it treats ana 's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film .
",3
118,"leigh makes these lives count .
",3
119,"igby goes down is one of those movies .
",2
120,"ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .
",3
121,"the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring .
",3
122,"i could n't recommend this film more .
",3
123,"an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn .
",1
124,"you can taste it , but there 's no fizz .
",1
125,"a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .
",1
126,"a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives .
",3
127,"it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .
",3
128,"why ?
",1
129,"and that is where ararat went astray .
",1
130,"vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role .
",3
131,"clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up .
",1
132,"sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
",1
133,"it 's mostly a pleasure to watch .
",3
134,"a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .
",2
135,"its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .
",3
136,"a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
",1
137,"i did n't find much fascination in the swinging .
",1
138,"this is no `` waterboy ! ''
",1
139,"but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .
",4
140,"a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking .
",2
141,"baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within .
",3
142,"the name says it all .
",2
143,"the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of .
",3
144,"it 's been 20 years since 48 hrs .
",2
145,"uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year .
",4
146,"the irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
",0
147,"it 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni .
",0
148,"he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
",1
149,"funny , though .
",2
150,"by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic .
",3
151,"the re-release of ron howard 's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .
",3
152,"unofficially , national lampoon 's van wilder is son of animal house .
",2
153,"it never is , not fully .
",2
154,"it 's just a little too self-satisfied .
",2
155,"i 've never seen -lrb- a remake -rrb- do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic ...
",0
156,"those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi .
",3
157,"post 9\/11 the philosophical message of `` personal freedom first '' might not be as palatable as intended .
",2
158,"mr. deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way .
",4
159,"this amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as greenfingers ...
",3
160,"my little eye is the best little `` horror '' movie i 've seen in years .
",4
161,"the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .

",3
163,"suffers from a flat script and a low budget .
",1
164,"the movie is well done , but slow .
",1
165,"the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .
",2
166,"the master of disguise is awful .
",0
167,"it 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .
",2
168,"same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse .
",2
169,"the film is one of the year 's best .
",4
170,"that the chuck norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .
",2
171,"frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for .
",2
172,"one of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces .
",4
173,"the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
",1
174,"the three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
",0
175,"`` looking for leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .
",1
176,"the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .

178,"oh , look at that clever angle !
",3
179,"warmed-over hash .
",2
180,"no , i hate it .
",0
181,"for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them .
",3
182,"the casting of raymond j. barry as the ` assassin ' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger 's impressive fake documentary .
",3
183,"the film is like sitting in a downtown caf챕 , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .
",0
184,"the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed .
",3
185,"a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending .
",4
186,"an hour and a half of joyful solo performance .
",4
187,"contrived pastiche of caper clich챕s .
",1
188,"a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light .
",4
189,"steven soderbergh 's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life .
",3
190,"kinnear 's performance is a career-defining revelation .
",4
191,"not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made .

192,"the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you wo n't be disappointed .

194,"for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven .

195,"scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .
",1
196,"really dumb but occasionally really funny .
",2
197,"this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama .
",1
198,"by the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
",3
199,"... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
",0
200,"largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .
",2
201,"the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals .
",1
202,"essentially `` fatal attraction '' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 .

215,"a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters .

217,"a rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hairs on your chest .
",3
218,"the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable .
",3
219,"the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
",1
220,"chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
",1
221,"the cast ... keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .

225,"there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out .
",3
226,"the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock 's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal .

228,"the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .

229,"and a very rainy day .
